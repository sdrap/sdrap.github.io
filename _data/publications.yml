      We test the robustness of the regime switching model for the pegged market USD-HKD introduced in S. Drapeau, Want T. and Wang T. (2021). In particular, two disputable underlying assumptions: 1) A Black and Scholes model with low volatility for the pre-depegging regime. 2) A thin tail distribution -- Poisson type -- for the time of the depegging. For the pre-depegging regime, we consider a bounded model within the pegg -- from Ingersoll and Rady. For the depegging time, we consider fat tail distributions more in line with catastrophic events -- Pareto/Frechet. We derive the option prices formula for each combination of these models and calibrate it to the option data from USD-HKD. In comparison to the benchmark model in \citep{drapeau2019}, it turns out that the relevant resulting characteristics -- probability of a depegging before maturity, appreciation/depreciation at the depegging time as well as post-depegging volatility -- are strongly robust in terms of model choice for this regime switching approach.

      We provide $q$-moment estimates on annuli for weak solutions of the singular $p$-Laplace equation where $p$ and $q$ are conjugates. We derive $q$-uniform integrability for some critical parameter range. As a application, we derive a mass conservation as well as a weak convergence result for a larger critical parameter range. Concerning the latter point, we further provide a rate of convergence of order $t^{q−1}$ of the solution in the $q$-Wasserstein distance.

      Spoofing is an illegal act of artificially modifying the supply to drive temporarily prices in a given direction for profit. In practice, detection of such an act is challenging due to the complexity of modern electronic platforms and the high frequency at which orders are channeled. We present a micro-structural study of spoofing in a simple static setting. A multilevel imbalance which influences the resulting price movement is introduced upon which we describe the optimization strategy of a potential spoofer. We provide conditions under which a market is more likely to admit spoofing behavior as a function of the characteristics of the market. We describe the optimal spoofing strategy after optimization which allows us to quantify the resulting impact on the imbalance after spoofing. Based on these results we calibrate the model to real Level 2 datasets from TMX, and provide some monitoring procedures based on the Wasserstein distance to detect spoofing strategies in real time.

      We consider sensitivity of a generic stochastic optimization problem to model uncertainty. We take a non-parametric approach and capture model uncertainty using Wasserstein balls around the postulated model. We provide explicit formulae for the first order correction to both the value function and the optimizer and further extend our results to optimization under linear constraints. We present applications to statistics, machine learning, mathematical finance and uncertainty quantification. In particular, we provide explicit first-order approximation for square-root LASSO regression coefficients and deduce coefficient shrinkage compared to the ordinary least squares regression. We consider robustness of call option pricing and deduce a new Black-Scholes sensitivity, a non-parametric version of the so-called Vega. We also compute sensitivities of optimized certainty equivalents in finance and propose measures to quantify robustness of neural networks to adversarial examples.

      We analyze a market impact game between n risk averse agents who compete for liquidity in a market impact model with permanent price impact and additional slippage. Most market parameters, including volatility and drift, are allowed to vary stochastically. Our first main result characterizes the Nash equilibrium in terms of a fully coupled system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). Our second main result provides conditions under which this system of FBSDEs has indeed a unique solution, which in turn yields the unique Nash equilibrium. We furthermore obtain closed-form solutions in special situations and analyze them numerically.

      The expectile can be considered as a generalization of quantile. While expected shortfall is a quantile based risk measure, we study its counterpart -- the expectile based expected shortfall -- where expectile takes the place of quantile. We provide its dual representation in terms of Bochner integral. Among other properties, we show that it is bounded from below in terms of convex combinations of expected shortfalls, and also from above by the smallest law invariant, coherent and comonotonic risk measure, for which we give the explicit formulation of the corresponding distortion function. As a benchmark to the industry standard expected shortfall we further provide its comparative asymptotic behavior in terms of extreme value distributions. Based on these results, we finally compute explicitly the expectile based expected shortfall for some selected class of distributions.

      This paper investigates the hedging performance of pegged foreign exchange market in a regime switching (RS) model introduced in a recent paper by Drapeau, Wang and Wang (2019). We compare two prices, an exact solution and first order approximation and provide the bounds for the error. We provide exact RS delta, approximated RS delta as well as mean variance hedging strategies for this specific model and compare their performance. To improve the efficiency of the pricing and calibration procedure, the Fourier approach of this regime-switching model is developed in our work. It turns out that: 1 - the calibration of the volatility surface with this regime switching model outperforms on real data the classical SABR model; 2 - the Fourier approach is significantly faster than the direct approach; 3 - in terms of hedging, the approximated RS delta hedge is a viable alternative to the exact RS delta hedge while significantly faster.

      In this paper, we study the prices of the options on Hong Kong’s linked exchange rate. The study was motivated by the apparent contradiction that options with strike prices outside the narrow trading band have positive prices. We developed a simple regime-switching model of the exchange rate and provided a formula for the prices of its options. The option pricing formula allows us to back out the implied probability of the failure of the linked exchange rate regime. With the option price data for the period from June 1, 2005 to July 31, 2018, we find that the market’s belief about the likelihoods of the failure, as implied by the option prices, is too high to be justified by the possibility of the failure alone. This is first shown qualitatively, without using any model, with ratio of empirical over implied volatilities and the implied range of strike prices. Then, using the model, we find that, close to 40% of the sample period, the market thinks the failure probability is greater than 10%. When contrasted with the fact that the regime has not failed since 1983, the p-value of that event is less than 0.1%. Our finding suggests that, while the failure of the linked exchange rate regime is a significant risk factor, it cannot explain the risk premium seen in the option prices.

      Expectile bears some interesting properties in comparison to the industry wide expected shortfall in terms of assessment of tail risk. We study the relationship between expectile and expected shortfall using duality results and the link to optimized certainty equivalent. Lower and upper bounds of expectile are derived in terms of expected shortfall as well as a characterization of expectile in terms of expected shortfall. Further, we study the asymptotic behavior of expectile with respect to expected shortfall as the risk level goes to 0 in terms of extreme value distributions. Illustrating the formulation of expectile in terms of expected shortfall, we also provide explicit or semi-explicit expressions of expectile for some classical distributions.

      Accounting for model uncertainty in risk management leads to infinite dimensional optimization problems which are both analytically and numerically untractable. In this article we study when this fact can be overcome for the so-called optimized certainty equivalent risk measure (OCE) - including the average value-at-risk as a special case. First we focus on the case where the set of possible distributions of a financial loss is given by the neighborhood of a given baseline distribution in the Wasserstein distance, or more generally, an optimal-transport distance. Here it turns out that the computation of the robust OCE reduces to a finite dimensional problem, which in some cases can even be solved explicitly. Further, we derive convex dual representations of the robust OCE for measurable claims without any assumptions on the set of distributions and finally give conditions on the latter set under which the robust average value-at-risk is a tail risk measure.

      We provide a verification and characterization result of optimal maximal sub-solutions of BSDEs in terms of fully coupled forward backward stochastic differential equations. We illustrate the application thereof in utility optimization with random endowment under probability and discounting uncertainty. We show with explicit examples how to quantify the costs of incompleteness when using utility indifference pricing, as well as a way to find optimal solutions for recursive utilities.

      In this article, we establish a Fenchel-Moreau type duality for proper convex and $\sigma(X,Y)$-lower semi-continuous functions $f\colon X\to \overline{L^0}$, where $(X,Y,\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle)$ is a dual pair of Banach spaces and $\overline{L^0}$ is the collection of all equivalence classes of extended real-valued random variables. The duality result is based on several conditional extensions and analytic tools from conditional set theory. As an application of our main result we derive a vector duality for increasing convex functions from a Banach lattice $X$ into $L^0$ in terms of dual elements in the Bochner-Lebesgue space $L^0(X^\ast)$. For convex functions $f\colon L^\infty \to L^0$ satisfying the Fatou continuity property, we derive a vector duality in terms of dual elements in the Bochner-Lebesgue space $L^0(L^1)$.

      The ongoing concern about systemic risk since the outburst of the global financial crisis has highlighted the need for risk measures at the level of sets of interconnected financial components, such as portfolios, institutions or members of clearing houses. The two main issues in systemic risk measurement are the computation of an overall reserve level and its allocation to the different components according to their systemic relevance. We develop here a pragmatic approach to systemic risk measurement and allocation based on multivariate shortfall risk measures, where acceptable allocations are first computed and then aggregated so as to minimize costs. We analyze the sensitivity of the risk allocations to various factors and highlight its relevance as an indicator of systemic risk. In particular, we study the interplay between the loss function and the dependence structure of the components. Moreover, we address the computational aspects of risk allocation. Finally, we apply this methodology to the allocation of the default fund of a CCP on real data.

      The code together with the numerical results can be viewed on [github](https://github.com/sdrap/msra)

    This paper provides a unified framework, which allows, in particular, to study the structure of dynamic monetary risk measures and dynamic acceptability indices.
    The main mathematical tool, which we use here, and which allows us to significantly generalize existing results is the theory of $$L^0$$-modules.
    In the first part of the paper we develop the general theory and provide a robust representation of conditional assessment indices, and in the second part we apply this theory to dynamic acceptability indices acting on stochastic processes.

    In this paper we derive a numerical representation for general complete preferences respecting the fol- lowing two principles: a) more is better than less, b) averages are better than extremes. To be able to distinguish between risk and ambiguity we work in an Anscombe–Aumann framework. Our main result is a quasi-concave numerical representation for a class of preferences wide enough to accommodate Ellsberg- as well as Allais-type behavior. Instead of assuming the usual monotonicity we suppose that our prefer- ences are monotone with respect to first order stochastic dominance. Preference for averages is expressed through convexity. No independence assumptions of any form are made. In general, our preferences in- tertwine attitudes towards risk and ambiguity. But if one assumes a weak form of Savage’s sure thing principle, there is separation between risk and ambiguity attitudes, and the representation decomposes into state dependent preference functionals over the consequences and a quasi-concave functional aggregating the preferences of the decision maker in different states of the world.

    We show stability and locality of the minimal supersolution of a forward backward stochastic differential equation with respect to the underlying forward process under weak assumptions on the generator. The forward process appears both in the generator and the terminal condition. Painlevé-Kuratowski and Convex Epi-convergence are used to establish the stability. For Markovian forward processes the minimal supersolution is shown to have the Markov property. Furthermore, it is related to a time-shifted problem and identified as a viscosity supersolution of a corresponding PDE.

    This work provides an axiomatic framework to the concept of conditional preference orders based on conditional sets.
    Conditional numerical representations of such preference orders are introduced and a conditional version of the theorems of Debreu about the existence of such numerical representations is given.
    The continuous representations follow from a conditional version of Debreu's Gap Lemma the proof of which is free of any measurable selection arguments but is derived from the existence of a conditional axiom of choice.

    In the paradigm of von Neumann-Morgenstern, a representation of affine preferences in terms of an expected utility can be obtained under the assumption of weak continuity. Since the weak topology is coarse, this requirement is a priori far from being negligible. In this work, we replace the assumption of weak continuity by monotonicity. More precisely, on the space of lotteries on an interval of the real line, it is shown that any affine preference order which is monotone with respect to the first stochastic order admits a representation in terms of an expected utility for some nondecreasing utility function. As a consequence, any affine preference order on the subset of lotteries with compact support, which is monotone with respect to the second stochastic order, can be represented in terms of an expected utility for some nondecreasing concave utility function. We also provide such representations for affine preference orders on the subset of those lotteries which fulfill some integrability conditions. The subtleties of the weak topology are illustrated by some examples.

    We give a dual representation of minimal supersolutions of BSDEs with non-bounded, but integrable terminal conditions and under weak requirements on the generator which is allowed to depend on the value process of the equation. 
    Conversely, we show that any dynamic risk measure satisfying such a dual representation stems from a BSDE.
    We also give a condition under which a supersolution of a BSDE is even a solution.

    We study the nonlinear operator of mapping the terminal value $$\xi$$ to the corresponding minimal supersolution of a backward stochastic differential equation with the generator being monotone in $$y$$, convex in $$z$$, jointly lower semicontinuous and bounded below by an affine function of the control variable $$z$$. We show existence, uniqueness, monotone convergence, Fatou’s lemma and lower semicontinuity of this operator. We provide a comparison principle for minimal supersolutions of BSDEs.

    We study the existence of minimal supersolutions of BSDEs under a family of mutually singular probability measures.
    We consider generators that are jointly lower semicontinuous, positive, and either convex in the control variable and monotone in the value variable, or that fulfill a specific normalization property.

    We introduce the notion of conditional set and conditional inclusion.
    We show that the resulting conditional power set is a complete Boolean algebra which allows to develop a conditional set theory, topology and functional analysis with a focus on conditional compactness.
    We construct the conditional real numbers and we prove, among others, the conditional version of the following theorems: Ultrafilter lemma, Tychonoff, Heine-Borel, Banach-Alaoglu and Krein-Šmulian.

    To address the plurality of interpretations of the subjective notion of risk, we describe it by means of a risk order and concentrate on the context invariant features of diversification and monotonicity. Our main results are uniquely characterized robust representations of lower semicontinuous risk orders on vector spaces and convex sets. This representation covers most instruments related to risk and allow for a differentiated interpretation depending on the underlying context which is illustrated in different settings: For random variables, risk perception can be interpreted as model risk, and we compute among others the robust representation of the economic index of riskiness. For lotteries, risk perception can be viewed as distributional risk and we study the “Value at Risk”. For consumption patterns, which excerpt an intertemporality dimension in risk perception, we provide an interpretation in terms of discounting risk and discuss some examples.

    The classical Brouwer fixed point theorem states that in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ every continuous function from a convex, compact set on itself has a fixed point.
    For an arbitrary probability space, let $$L^0=L^0(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P)$$ be the set of random variables.
    We consider $$(L^0)^d$$ as an $$L^0$$-module and show that local, sequentially continuous functions on $$L^0$$-convex, closed and bounded subsets have a fixed point which is measurable by construction.

    We consider the class of risk measures associated with optimized certainty equivalents. This class includes several popular examples, such as conditional value-at-risk (CV@R) and monotone mean–variance. Numerical schemes are developed for the computation of these risk measures using Fourier transform methods. This leads, in particular, to a very competitive method for the calculation of CVa@R, which is comparable in computational time to the calculation of V@R. We also develop methods for the efficient computation of risk contributions.
