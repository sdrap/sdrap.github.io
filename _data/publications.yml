      The ongoing concern about systemic risk since the outburst of the global financial crisis has highlighted the need for risk measures at the level of sets of interconnected financial components, such as portfolios, institutions or members of clearing houses. The two main issues in systemic risk are the computation of an overall reserve level and its allocation to the different components according to their systemic relevance. We develop here a pragmatic approach to systemic risk measurement and allocation based on multivariate shortfall risk measures, where acceptable allocations are first computed and then aggregated so as to minimize costs. We analyze the sensitivity of the risk allocations to various factors and highlight its relevance as an indicator of systemic risk. Moreover, we provide numerical schemes to assess the risk allocation in high dimensions.

      The code together with the numerical results can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/sdrap/MSRA)

    This paper provides a unified framework, which allows, in particular, to study the structure of dynamic monetary risk measures and dynamic acceptability indices.
    The main mathematical tool, which we use here, and which allows us to significantly generalize existing results is the theory of $$L^0$$-modules.
    In the first part of the paper we develop the general theory and provide a robust representation of conditional assessment indices, and in the second part we apply this theory to dynamic acceptability indices acting on stochastic processes.

    In this paper we derive a numerical representation for general complete preferences respecting the fol- lowing two principles: a) more is better than less, b) averages are better than extremes. To be able to distinguish between risk and ambiguity we work in an Anscombe–Aumann framework. Our main result is a quasi-concave numerical representation for a class of preferences wide enough to accommodate Ellsberg- as well as Allais-type behavior. Instead of assuming the usual monotonicity we suppose that our prefer- ences are monotone with respect to first order stochastic dominance. Preference for averages is expressed through convexity. No independence assumptions of any form are made. In general, our preferences in- tertwine attitudes towards risk and ambiguity. But if one assumes a weak form of Savage’s sure thing principle, there is separation between risk and ambiguity attitudes, and the representation decomposes into state dependent preference functionals over the consequences and a quasi-concave functional aggregating the preferences of the decision maker in different states of the world.

    We show stability and locality of the minimal supersolution of a forward backward stochastic differential equation with respect to the underlying forward process under weak assumptions on the generator. The forward process appears both in the generator and the terminal condition. Painlevé-Kuratowski and Convex Epi-convergence are used to establish the stability. For Markovian forward processes the minimal supersolution is shown to have the Markov property. Furthermore, it is related to a time-shifted problem and identified as a viscosity supersolution of a corresponding PDE.

    This work provides an axiomatic framework to the concept of conditional preference orders based on conditional sets.
    Conditional numerical representations of such preference orders are introduced and a conditional version of the theorems of Debreu about the existence of such numerical representations is given.
    The continuous representations follow from a conditional version of Debreu's Gap Lemma the proof of which is free of any measurable selection arguments but is derived from the existence of a conditional axiom of choice.

    In the paradigm of von Neumann-Morgenstern, a representation of affine preferences in terms of an expected utility can be obtained under the assumption of weak continuity. Since the weak topology is coarse, this requirement is a priori far from being negligible. In this work, we replace the assumption of weak continuity by monotonicity. More precisely, on the space of lotteries on an interval of the real line, it is shown that any affine preference order which is monotone with respect to the first stochastic order admits a representation in terms of an expected utility for some nondecreasing utility function. As a consequence, any affine preference order on the subset of lotteries with compact support, which is monotone with respect to the second stochastic order, can be represented in terms of an expected utility for some nondecreasing concave utility function. We also provide such representations for affine preference orders on the subset of those lotteries which fulfill some integrability conditions. The subtleties of the weak topology are illustrated by some examples.

    We give a dual representation of minimal supersolutions of BSDEs with non-bounded, but integrable terminal conditions and under weak requirements on the generator which is allowed to depend on the value process of the equation. 
    Conversely, we show that any dynamic risk measure satisfying such a dual representation stems from a BSDE.
    We also give a condition under which a supersolution of a BSDE is even a solution.

    We study the nonlinear operator of mapping the terminal value $$\xi$$ to the corresponding minimal supersolution of a backward stochastic differential equation with the generator being monotone in $$y$$, convex in $$z$$, jointly lower semicontinuous and bounded below by an affine function of the control variable $$z$$. We show existence, uniqueness, monotone convergence, Fatou’s lemma and lower semicontinuity of this operator. We provide a comparison principle for minimal supersolutions of BSDEs.

    To address the plurality of interpretations of the subjective notion of risk, we describe it by means of a risk order and concentrate on the context invariant features of diversification and monotonicity. Our main results are uniquely characterized robust representations of lower semicontinuous risk orders on vector spaces and convex sets. This representation covers most instruments related to risk and allow for a differentiated interpretation depending on the underlying context which is illustrated in different settings: For random variables, risk perception can be interpreted as model risk, and we compute among others the robust representation of the economic index of riskiness. For lotteries, risk perception can be viewed as distributional risk and we study the “Value at Risk”. For consumption patterns, which excerpt an intertemporality dimension in risk perception, we provide an interpretation in terms of discounting risk and discuss some examples.

    For an arbitrary probability space, let $$L^0=L^0(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P)$$ be the set of random variables.
    We consider $$(L^0)^d$$ as an $$L^0$$-module and show that local, sequentially continuous functions on $$L^0$$-convex, closed and bounded subsets have a fixed point which is measurable by construction.

    We consider the class of risk measures associated with optimized certainty equivalents. This class includes several popular examples, such as conditional value-at-risk (CV@R) and monotone mean–variance. Numerical schemes are developed for the computation of these risk measures using Fourier transform methods. This leads, in particular, to a very competitive method for the calculation of CVa@R, which is comparable in computational time to the calculation of V@R. We also develop methods for the efficient computation of risk contributions.
