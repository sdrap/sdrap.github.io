--------------------------------------

I have a position as Associate Professor at the [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn) in China at the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.sjtu.edu.cn/).
I am also Affiliated Professor at [Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance (SAIF)](http://saif.sjtu.edu.cn).

My research focus &mdash; even if not bounded to &mdash; are

* Stochastic and Convex Analysis
* Decision Theory
* Risk and Uncertainty
* Data Analysis



Lecture Notes:
:   I recently experimented with lecture notes online using [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
    Those are work in progress, available publicly on github for forking, correcting, pulling requests, as well as the template I am using.

    The following lecture notes are available:
    
    * [**Advanced Scientific Programming**]({{site.url}}/ASP_Lecture/)

        [source code](https://github.com/sdrap/ASP_Lecture)
        
        *It is rather an introduction to scientific programming for mathematicians*.
    * [**Financial Mathematics**]({{site.url}}/FM_Lecture/)

        [source code](https://github.com/sdrap/FM_Lecture)

    * [**Stochastic**]({{site.url}}/SP_Lecture/) 

        [source code](https://github.com/sdrap/SP_Lecture)

        *Still in the process of writing chapters 5 to 12 during this semester.*
