## Conference on Stochastic Analysis, Stochastic Dynamical Systems and Stochastic Finance
{: style="text-align:center"}

#### Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Mathematical Sciences
{: style="text-align:center"}

<br>
-----

In recent years, fundamental advances have been made in different areas of stochastics -- from stochastic partial differential equations, ergodic theory to manifold valued stochastic differential equations as well as non-dominated models and transport methods in financial mathematics.

The School of Mathematical Sciences takes this opportunity to bring together those working on different areas of research related to stochastics to exchange on common issues, their respective approaches, new results and new research directions.
Alongside the presentation of each speaker, this conference also intends to facilitate research discussions and interactions in a stimulating and convivial atmosphere.

Attendance is open to any interested participants up to capacity.
Therefore, would you like to attend, we kindly ask you to register by sending a mail to [Hu Jie](mailto:hujie150@sjtu.edu.cn).

**Title**
:   All adapted topologies are equal 

**Abstract**
:   Several researchers have introduced topological structures on the set of laws of stochastic processes. A unifying goal of these authors is to strengthen the usual weak topology in order to adequately capture the temporal structure of stochastic processes. We find that all of these seemingly independent approaches define the same topology in finite discrete time. Moreover, we explain how optimal transport theory can be used obtain a compatible metric that is both tractable and highly relevant for a number of questions in mathematical finance.

**Title**
:   On the geometry of some rough Weierstrass curves: SBR measure and
local time 

**Abstract**
:   We investigate geometric properties of Weierstrass curves with one or two components, representing series based on trigonometric functions. They are Hoelder continuous, and not (para-)controlled with respect to each other. They can be embedded into a smooth dynamical system, where their graph emerges as a pullback attractor. Each one-dimensional component of the curve may also be seen in the light of this dynamical system. It turns out that occupation measures and Sinai-Bowen-Ruelle (SBR) measures on its stable manifold are dual to each other, via time reversal. A suitable version of approximate self similarity for deterministic functions yields approximate scaling properties for the measures. As a consequence, absolute continuity of the SBR measure is obtained, as well as the existence of a local time. The link between rough Weierstrass curves and smooth dynamical systems can be generalized considerably. Applications to regularization of singular ODE by rough (Weierstrass type) signals are on our agenda. This is joint work with G. dos Reis (U Edinburgh) and O. Pamen (U Liverpool and AIMS Ghana).

**Title**
:   Ergodicities and exponential ergodicities of branching processes with immigration
  

**Abstract**
:   Under natural assumptions, we prove the ergodicities and exponential ergodicities in Wasserstein and total variation distances of Dawson-Watanabe superprocesses without or with immigration. Those processes are infinite-dimensional generalizations of the well-known continuous-state branching processes, which are also known as Cox-Ingersoll-Ross type models and have played important roles in the study of mathematical finance. The strong Feller property of the processes in the total variation distance is derived as a by-product. The key of our approach is a set of estimates for the variations of the transition probabilities. The estimates in Wasserstein distance are derived from an upper bound of the kernels induced by the first moment of the superprocess. Those in total variation distance are based on a comparison of the cumulant semigroup of the superprocess with that of a continuous-state branching process. The results improve and extend considerably those of Stannat (2003a, 2003b) and Friesen (2019+). We also show a connection between the ergodicities of the associated immigration superprocesses and decomposable distributions.

**Title**
:   Asymptotic Formulas for Empirical Measures of (Reflecting) Diffusion Processes on Riemannian Manifolds

**Abstract**
:   Consider the (reflecting) diffusion process $$(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$$ generated by $$L:= \Delta+\nabla V$$ on a compact connected Riemannian manifold $$M$$ possibly with a boundary $$\partial M$$, where $$V\in C^2(M)$$ is such that $$\mu(d x) :=e^{V(x)} d x$$ is a probability measure. Then  the  empirical measures \begin{equation}\mu_{t}:=\frac{1}{t}\int_0^t \delta_{X_s} d s,\ \ t>0 \end{equation} satisfy \begin{equation} \lim_{t\to \infty}  \big\\{t \mathbb{E}^x \left[W_2(\mu_{t},\mu)^2\right]\big\\}= \sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{2}{\lambda_i^2} \text{ uniformly in }  x\in M,\end{equation} where $\mathbb{E}^x$ is the expectation for the diffusion process starting at point $x$, $W_2$ is the $L^2$-Warsserstein distance induced by the Riemannian metric, and the limit is finite if and only if $d\leq 3$. Moreover, when $d\geq 4$ the main order of $\mathbb{E}^x[W_2(\mu_{t},\mu)^2]$ is $t^{- 2/(d-2)}$ as $t\to\infty$.

**Title**
:   Rational inattention and dynamic discrete choice 

**Abstract**
:   We adopt the posterior-based approach to study dynamic discrete choice problems with rational inattention. We show that the optimal solution for the Shannon entropy case is characterized by a system of equations that resembles the dynamic logit rule. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve this system and apply our model to explain phenomena such as status quo bias, confirmation bias, and belief polarization. We also study the dynamics of consideration sets. Unlike the choice-based approach, our approach applies to general uniformly posterior-separable information cost functions. A key condition for our approach to work in dynamic models is the convexity of the difference between the discounted (generalized) entropy of the prior beliefs about the future states and the entropy of the current posterior. This is a joint work with Jianjun Miao.

**Title**
:   A discretized version of Krylov's estimate and its applications 

**Abstract**
:   In this paper we prove a discretized version of Krylov's estimate for discretized Ito's processes. As applications, we study the weak and strong convergences for Euler's approximation of mean-field SDEs with measurable discontinuous and linear growth coefficients. Moreover, we also show the propagation of chaos for Euler's approximation of mean-field SDEs.
