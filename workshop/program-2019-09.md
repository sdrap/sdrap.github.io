**Title**
:   All adapted topologies are equal 

**Abstract**
:   Several researchers have introduced topological structures on the set of laws of stochastic processes. A unifying goal of these authors is to strengthen the usual weak topology in order to adequately capture the temporal structure of stochastic processes. We find that all of these seemingly independent approaches define the same topology in finite discrete time. Moreover, we explain how optimal transport theory can be used obtain a compatible metric that is both tractable and highly relevant for a number of questions in mathematical finance.

**Title**
:   Stability of heat kernel estimates and parabolic Harnack inequalities for symmetric Dirichlet forms 

**Abstract**
:   In this talk, I will present recent progress in the study of heat kernels and parabolic Harnack inequalities for symmetric Markov processes that have both diffusive and jumping parts on general metric measure spaces.  Under general volume doubling condition and some mild assumptions on the scaling functions, we establish stability results for two-sided estimates for heat kernels in terms of the jumping kernels, the generalized capacity inequalities, and Poincare inequalities. Stable characterizations of the associated parabolic Harnack inequalities will also be given. Our results hold on spaces even when the underlying spaces have walk dimensions are larger than 2. Joint work with Takashi Kumagai and Jian Wang.

**Title**
:   Asset Prices in Segmented and Integrated Markets 

**Abstract**
:   This paper evaluates the effect of market integration on prices and welfare, in a model where two Lucas trees grow in separate regions with similar investors. We find equilibrium asset price dynamics and welfare both in segmentation, when each region holds its own asset and consumes its dividend, and in integration, when both regions trade both assets and consume both dividends. Integration always increases welfare. Asset prices may increase or decrease, depending on the time of integration, but decrease on average. Correlation in assets' returns is zero or negative before integration, but significantly positive afterwards, explaining some effects commonly associated with financialization.

**Title**
:   On the geometry of some rough Weierstrass curves: SBR measure and
local time 

**Abstract**
:   We investigate geometric properties of Weierstrass curves with one or two components, representing series based on trigonometric functions. They are Hoelder continuous, and not (para-)controlled with respect to each other. They can be embedded into a smooth dynamical system, where their graph emerges as a pullback attractor. Each one-dimensional component of the curve may also be seen in the light of this dynamical system. It turns out that occupation measures and Sinai-Bowen-Ruelle (SBR) measures on its stable manifold are dual to each other, via time reversal. A suitable version of approximate self similarity for deterministic functions yields approximate scaling properties for the measures. As a consequence, absolute continuity of the SBR measure is obtained, as well as the existence of a local time. The link between rough Weierstrass curves and smooth dynamical systems can be generalized considerably. Applications to regularization of singular ODE by rough (Weierstrass type) signals are on our agenda. This is joint work with G. dos Reis (U Edinburgh) and O. Pamen (U Liverpool and AIMS Ghana).

**Title**
:   Nonlinear expectations under Wasserstein uncertainty and convex semigroups

**Abstract**
:   We provide general results for convex semigroups, in particular uniqueness in terms of the generator. As an example, we consider scaling limits of Levy processes under distributional uncertainty with respect to (martingale) transport distances. The talk is based on joint works with Daniel Bartl, Robert Denk and Max Nendel.

**Title**
:   Ergodicities and exponential ergodicities of branching processes with immigration
  

**Abstract**
:   Under natural assumptions, we prove the ergodicities and exponential ergodicities in Wasserstein and total variation distances of Dawson-Watanabe superprocesses without or with immigration. Those processes are infinite-dimensional generalizations of the well-known continuous-state branching processes, which are also known as Cox-Ingersoll-Ross type models and have played important roles in the study of mathematical finance. The strong Feller property of the processes in the total variation distance is derived as a by-product. The key of our approach is a set of estimates for the variations of the transition probabilities. The estimates in Wasserstein distance are derived from an upper bound of the kernels induced by the first moment of the superprocess. Those in total variation distance are based on a comparison of the cumulant semigroup of the superprocess with that of a continuous-state branching process. The results improve and extend considerably those of Stannat (2003a, 2003b) and Friesen (2019+). We also show a connection between the ergodicities of the associated immigration superprocesses and decomposable distributions.

**Title**
:   Stochastic LQ and Associated Riccati equation of PDEs Driven by State- and Control-Dependent White Noise

**Abstract**
:   The optimal stochastic control problem with a quadratic cost functional for linear partial differential equations (PDEs) driven by a state- and control-dependent white noise is formulated and studied. Both finite- and infinite-time horizons are considered. The multi- plicative white noise dynamics of the system give rise to a new phenomenon of singularity to the associated Riccati equation and even to the Lyapunov equation. Well-posedness of both Riccati equation and Lyapunov equation are obtained for the first time. The linear feedback coefficient of the optimal control turns out to be singular and expressed in terms of the solution of the associated Riccati equation. The null controllability is shown to be equivalent to the existence of the solution to Riccati equation with the singular terminal value. Finally, the controlled Anderson model is addressed as an illustrating example. This is a joint work with Ying Hu.

**Title**
:   Continuous-time Principal-Agent problem and optimal planning

**Abstract**
:   Motivated by the approach introduced by Sanninkov to solve principal-agent problems, we provide a solution approach which allows to address a wider range of problems. The key argument uses a representation result from the theory of backward stochastic differential equations. This methodology extends to the mean field game version of the problem, and provides a connexion with the P.-L. Lions optimal planning problem.

**Title**
:   Absence of arbitrage without a numeraire 

**Abstract**
:   We propose a new approach to defining and characterising absence of arbitrage in a way which does not depend on an a priori chosen numeraire. In spirit, this is similar to Kabanov's approach to modelling markets with transaction costs. The key idea is that the comparison basis for a profit is no longer wealth, which is numeraire-dependent, but a chosen reference portfolio, which is in units of assets and hence numeraire-independent. We provide dual characterisations in terms of discounting and martingale properties, and we also discuss to which extent the approach and results depend on the reference portfolio. This is based on joint work with Daniel Balint.

**Title**
:   Asymptotic Formulas for Empirical Measures of (Reflecting) Diffusion Processes on Riemannian Manifolds

**Abstract**
:   Consider the (reflecting) diffusion process $$(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$$ generated by $$L:= \Delta+\nabla V$$ on a compact connected Riemannian manifold $$M$$ possibly with a boundary $$\partial M$$, where $$V\in C^2(M)$$ is such that $$\mu(d x) :=e^{V(x)} d x$$ is a probability measure. Then  the  empirical measures \begin{equation}\mu_{t}:=\frac{1}{t}\int_0^t \delta_{X_s} d s,\ \ t>0 \end{equation} satisfy \begin{equation} \lim_{t\to \infty}  \big\\{t \mathbb{E}^x \left[W_2(\mu_{t},\mu)^2\right]\big\\}= \sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{2}{\lambda_i^2} \text{ uniformly in }  x\in M,\end{equation} where $\mathbb{E}^x$ is the expectation for the diffusion process starting at point $x$, $W_2$ is the $L^2$-Warsserstein distance induced by the Riemannian metric, and the limit is finite if and only if $d\leq 3$. Moreover, when $d\geq 4$ the main order of $\mathbb{E}^x[W_2(\mu_{t},\mu)^2]$ is $t^{- 2/(d-2)}$ as $t\to\infty$.

**Title**
:   Pricing basket CDS with some certain dependent default risk 

**Abstract**
:   In this talk, we consider the basket CDS spreads under some reduced form credit risk models. We explain how the default intensity of a defaultable firm can be defined as the intensity of a point process. The dependence of default can be described by the dependence among the default intensity processes of defaultable firms with contagion (interacting), the conditional independence, the common shock and the regime switching. We derive some closed form joint distributions for default times and present some analytic pricing formulas for the basket CDS spreads under the proposed credit risk models.

**Title**
:   Rational inattention and dynamic discrete choice 

**Abstract**
:   We adopt the posterior-based approach to study dynamic discrete choice problems with rational inattention. We show that the optimal solution for the Shannon entropy case is characterized by a system of equations that resembles the dynamic logit rule. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve this system and apply our model to explain phenomena such as status quo bias, confirmation bias, and belief polarization. We also study the dynamics of consideration sets. Unlike the choice-based approach, our approach applies to general uniformly posterior-separable information cost functions. A key condition for our approach to work in dynamic models is the convexity of the difference between the discounted (generalized) entropy of the prior beliefs about the future states and the entropy of the current posterior. This is a joint work with Jianjun Miao.

**Title**
:   A discretized version of Krylov's estimate and its applications 

**Abstract**
:   In this paper we prove a discretized version of Krylov's estimate for discretized Ito's processes. As applications, we study the weak and strong convergences for Euler's approximation of mean-field SDEs with measurable discontinuous and linear growth coefficients. Moreover, we also show the propagation of chaos for Euler's approximation of mean-field SDEs.
