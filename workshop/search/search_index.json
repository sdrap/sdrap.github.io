The corresponding analysis is inherently distinct from that of classical stochastic calculus, and neither theory alone is able to satisfactorily handle hybrid systems driven by both rough and stochastic noise (as sometimes appear, e.g., in stochastic filtering, pathwise stochastic control, and mixed Black-Scholes models). The introduction of the stochastic sewing lemma (Khoa L\u00ea, 2020) has paved the way for a theory which can efficiently handle such hybrid systems. In this talk, we will discuss how this can be done in a general setting which allows for jump discontinuities in both sources of noise.

By providing a dynamic programming principle we obtain a local-to-global paradigm, namely solving a local, i.e., a one time-step robust optimization problem leads to an optimizer of the global (i.e. infinite time-steps) robust stochastic optimal control problem, as well as to a corresponding worst-case measure.Moreover, we apply this framework to portfolio optimization involving data of the S&amp;P 500. We present two different types of ambiguity sets; one is fully data-driven given by a Wasserstein-ball around the empirical measure, the second one is described by a parametric set of multivariate normal distributions, where the corresponding uncertainty sets of the parameters are estimated from the data. It turns out that in scenarios where the market is volatile or bearish, the optimal portfolio strategies from the corresponding robust optimization problem outperforms the ones without model uncertainty, showcasing the importance of taking model uncertainty into account.

Since dividend payments are irreversible, this problem corresponds to a singular control problem with a risk-neutral utility function applied to the discounted dividend stream. In cases where the company's surplus process encounters model ambiguity under the Brownian filtration, we explore robust dividend payment strategies in worst-case scenarios. Two possible robust preferences are examined and compared. Using Epstein-Zin (EZ) preferences, we formulate the robust dividend problem as a recursive utility function with the EZ aggregator within a singular control framework. We investigate the existence and uniqueness of the EZ dividend problem. By employing Backward Stochastic Differential Equation theory, we demonstrate that the EZ formulation is equivalent to the maximin problem involving risk-neutral utility on the discounted dividend stream, incorporating Meanhout's regularity that reflects investors' ambiguity aversion. In other words, we establish a connection between ambiguity aversion in a robust singular control problem and risk aversion in EZ preferences. Additionally, considering the equivalent Meanhout's preferences, we solve the robust dividend problem using a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approach combined with a variational inequality (VI). Our solution is obtained through a novel shooting method that simultaneously satisfies the VI and boundary conditions.

Also the associated cost functional is of mean-field type. Under the assumption of a convex control state space we study the stochastic maximum principle, which gives a necessary optimality condition for control processes. Under additional convexity assumptions on the Hamiltonian it is shown that this necessary condition is also a sufficient one.

The corresponding analysis is inherently distinct from that of classical stochastic calculus, and neither theory alone is able to satisfactorily handle hybrid systems driven by both rough and stochastic noise (as sometimes appear, e.g., in stochastic filtering, pathwise stochastic control, and mixed Black-Scholes models). The introduction of the stochastic sewing lemma (Khoa L\u00ea, 2020) has paved the way for a theory which can efficiently handle such hybrid systems.

By providing a dynamic programming principle we obtain a local-to-global paradigm, namely solving a local, i.e., a one time-step robust optimization problem leads to an optimizer of the global (i.e. infinite time-steps) robust stochastic optimal control problem, as well as to a corresponding worst-case measure.Moreover, we apply this framework to portfolio optimization involving data of the S&amp;P 500. We present two different types of ambiguity sets; one is fully data-driven given by a Wasserstein-ball around the empirical measure, the second one is described by a parametric set of multivariate normal distributions, where the corresponding uncertainty sets of the parameters are estimated from the data. It turns out that in scenarios where the market is volatile or bearish, the optimal portfolio strategies from the corresponding robust optimization problem outperforms the ones without model uncertainty, showcasing the importance of taking model uncertainty into account.

Our model allows us to observe new effects resulting from the interplay between the transaction costs and the stochastic investment opportunities.

We subsequently derive semi-analytical expressions to compute the relevant probabilities within the context of state-dependent stochastic order flows. These probabilities cover various scenarios, including the probability of a change in the mid-price, the execution probabilities of orders posted at the best quotes, and those posted at a price level deeper in the book, before the opposite best quote moves.

Since dividend payments are irreversible, this problem corresponds to a singular control problem with a risk-neutral utility function applied to the discounted dividend stream. In cases where the company's surplus process encounters model ambiguity under the Brownian filtration, we explore robust dividend payment strategies in worst-case scenarios. Two possible robust preferences are examined and compared. Using Epstein-Zin (EZ) preferences, we formulate the robust dividend problem as a recursive utility function with the EZ aggregator within a singular control framework. We investigate the existence and uniqueness of the EZ dividend problem. By employing Backward Stochastic Differential Equation theory, we demonstrate that the EZ formulation is equivalent to the maximin problem involving risk-neutral utility on the discounted dividend stream, incorporating Meanhout's regularity that reflects investors' ambiguity aversion. In other words, we establish a connection between ambiguity aversion in a robust singular control problem and risk aversion in EZ preferences. Additionally, considering the equivalent Meanhout's preferences, we solve the robust dividend problem using a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approach combined with a variational inequality (VI). Our solution is obtained through a novel shooting method that simultaneously satisfies the VI and boundary conditions.

Our calibrated model matches the savings distribution observed in the U.S. After requiring that the two UI policies have the same cost, we find: (1) a large, one-time lumpsum payment results in lower unemployment rates relative to a moderate, long-lived increase in benefits and (2) both policies deliver approximately the same ex-ante expected utility to unemployed individuals.

We study the asymptotic limit of the SE-MPD, which converges at a parametric rate as the sample size increases if the pairs are either i.i.d. or satisfy appropriate mixing assumptions. Additional finite-sample results are also investigated.

Also the associated cost functional is of mean-field type. Under the assumption of a convex control state space we study the stochastic maximum principle, which gives a necessary optimality condition for control processes. Under additional convexity assumptions on the Hamiltonian it is shown that this necessary condition is also a sufficient one.

In contrast to the single agent's control problem in Jia and Zhou (2023), the mean-field interaction of agents renders the definition of the q-function more subtle, for which we reveal that two distinct \\(q\\)-functions naturally arise: (i) the integrated q-function as the first-order approximation of the integrated \\(Q\\)-function introduced in Gu, Guo, Wei and Xu (2023), which can be learnt by a weak martingale condition involving test policies; and (ii) the essential q-function that is employed in policy improvement iterations. We show that two \\(q\\)-functions are related via an integral representation under all test policies. Based on the weak martingale condition and our proposed searching method of test policies, some model-free learning algorithms are devised. In two financial application examples, one in \\(LQ\\) control framework and one beyond \\(LQ\\) control framework, we can obtain the exact parameterization of the optimal value function and \\(q\\)-functions and illustrate our algorithms with simulation experiments.

The formulation overcomes the limitations of existing models by incorporating the intertemporal dynamics of market information variables not limited to prices, allowing exact calculation of transaction costs, accounting for the tradeoff between overall tracking error and transaction costs, allowing effective use of data in a long time period, etc. The formulation also allows novel decision variables of cash injection or withdraw. We propose to solve the portfolio rebalancing equation using a Banach fixed point iteration, which allows to accurately calculate the transaction costs specified as nonlinear functions of trading volumes in practice. We propose an extension of deep reinforcement learning (RL) method to solve the dynamic formulation. Our RL method resolves the issue of data limitation resulting from the availability of a single sample path of financial data by a novel training scheme. A comprehensive empirical study based on a 17-year-long testing set demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms a benchmark method in terms of tracking accuracy and has the potential for earning extra profit through cash withdraw strategy.

We study the continuous-time counterpart of the \\(Q\\)-function in the mean-field model, coined as \\(q\\)-function in Jia and Zhou (2023) in the single agents model. It is shown that the controlled common noise gives rise to a nonlocal term of the policy in the exploratory HJB equation, rendering the policy improvement iteration intricate. To devise the model-free RL algorithm, we introduce the integrated \\(q\\)-function (\\(Iq\\)-function) on distributions of both state and action, and an optimal policy can be identified as a two-layer fixed point to the argmax operator of the Iq-function. The martingale characterization of the value function and \\(Iq\\)-function is established by exhausting all test policies. This allows us to propose several algorithms including the Actor-Critic learning algorithm, in which the policy is updated in the Actor-step based on the policy improvement rule induced by the linear derivative of the Iq-function with respect to the action distribution, and the value function and Iq-function are updated in the Critic-step based on the orthogonal martingale loss function involving all test policies. In two examples, within and beyond LQ-control framework, we implement and compare some simulation experiments of our RL algorithms with satisfactory performance.

The introduction of the potential function is powerful as it simplifies  the otherwise challenging task of searching for Nash equilibria in  multi-agent non-cooperative games:  maximizers of potential functions lead to the game's Nash equilibria. In this talk, we propose an analogous and new framework called \\(\\alpha\\)-potential game for  dynamic \\(N\\)-Player games, with the potential function in the static setting replaced by an  \\(\\alpha\\)-potential function. We will present the analytical criteria for any game to be an \\(\\alpha\\)-potential game, and identify several important classes of Markov \\(\\alpha\\)-potential games.   We will provide detailed analysis for games with mean-field interactions, distributed games, and  crowd aversion games, in which \\(\\alpha\\) is shown to depend on the number of players, the admissible policies, and the cost structure.

The method is stable and convergent. There is no need to worry about the boundary condition. Furthermore, the whole numerical process actually yields the samples to estimate the expectation \\(E[\\phi(X)]\\). As we know, direct sampling for a \\(G\\)-normal RV \\(X\\) is infeasible due to the uncertainty of its distribution. But for a \u201cmeasurement\u201d \\(E[\\phi(X)]\\), the sampling is feasible.

The intermediary utilizes two remuneration systems, namely, a fee-for-advice system and a commission system. Insurance contracting between the buyer (represented by the intermediary) and an insurer, is formulated as a Stackelberg insurance game. We obtain the buyer\u2019s equilibrium indemnity and the insurer\u2019s equilibrium pricing strategy in closed forms, and subsequently conduct comparative statics analysis with respect to the intermediary\u2019s level of fiduciary duty and remuneration. Our results show that the phenomenon of over-insuring despite high premium, a long-standing paradox in insurance economics, also attributes to the deficiency of the intermediary\u2019s fiduciary duty.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Yufei Zhang Imperial College London (1)</p> <ol> <li> <p>\"Some Recent Progress in Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning\"</p> <p>Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted substantial research interests. Much of the attention and success, however, has been for the discrete-time setting. Continuous-time RL, despite its natural analytical connection to stochastic controls, has been largely unexplored and with limited progress. In particular, characterising sample efficiency for continuous-time RL algorithms remains a challenging and open problem. In this talk, we will discuss some recent advances in the convergence rate analysis for the episodic linear-convex RL problem, and report regret bounds of various learning algorithms.  The approach is probabilistic, involving analysing learning efficiency using concentration inequalities for correlated observations, and quantifying the performance of feedback controls derived from estimated models.

We introduce a proxy process that substitutes the mean-field interaction with self-interaction through a weighted occupation measure of the particle's past. If the McKean-Vlasov diffusion is the gradient flow of a convex mean-field potential functional, we show that the self-interacting process exponentially converges towards its unique invariant measure close to that of the McKean-Vlasov diffusion.

Our approach leverages grouping data in proximity to varying query points, employing two distinct methods: one based on a fixed-radius ball and the other on nearest neighbors. We establish upper bounds for the convergence rates of both methods and, from these bounds, deduce optimal configurations for the radius and the number of neighbors. To obtain a Lipschitz continuous estimator of the conditional distribution for enhanced certifiability, we incorporate the nearest neighbor method into neural network training. For improved efficiency, the training process utilizes approximate nearest neighbor search with random binary space partitioning. Additionally, it employs Sinkhorn algorithm and sparsity-enforced transport plan for training objective computation. Our empirical findings reveal that, with a suitably designed structure, the neural network displays adaptive continuity.

The classical optimal control of such a problem is of the bang-bang type, which is overly sensitive to errors. A remedy is to allow the diffusions to explore other temperature values and hence smooth out the bang-bang control. We accomplish this by a stochastic relaxed control formulation incorporating randomization of the temperature control and regularizing its entropy. We derive a state-dependent, truncated exponential distribution, which can be used to sample temperatures in a Langevin algorithm, in terms of the solution to an HJB partial differential equation. We carry out a numerical experiment on a one- dimensional baseline example, in which the HJB equation can be easily solved, to compare the performance of the algorithm with three other available algorithms in search of a global optimum.
