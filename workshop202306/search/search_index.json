In order to control these costs, this paper proposes a dynamic capital allocation problem that incorporates reallocation costs into the loss function and uses a dynamic programming framework to optimize the problem. Additionally, the stochastic constraints associated with the full allocation requirement are incorporated into the problem formulation. We obtain an analytical expression for the solution of the proposed problem in a recursive form and demonstrate its performance through numerical simulations. Our results indicate that the solution opti- mizes the overall loss function, and the reallocation costs are worthwhile considering. Furthermore, our approach strikes an effective balance between addressing current risk profiles and preparing for future ones. This dynamic capital allocation method successfully functions as a risk-based capital allocation tool while preserving the ility of stable allocation.

In this article, we provides an explanation for this phenomenon through an optimal liquidation game with a major trader. This framework contains (i) a major trader who is liquidating a large number of shares facing an objective with a periodicity and (ii) a number of minor traders(high-frequency traders (HFTs)) who detect and trade against the liquidator. All the traders interact with each other through their impacts on the price dynamics, and we solve this problem by a mean-field game approach. Our results yield open-loop trading strategies for both major and minor traders, highlighting the periodicity in the optimal strategies of all participants. Moreover, we demonstrate that the presence of minor traders, although without periodic objectives, amplifies the periodicity of trading speed across the entire market.

Disclosure increases price efficiency but has mixed welfare implications. If the insider has large liquidity needs, in contrast to the conventional wisdom from \"sunshine trading,\" disclosure can even reduce the welfare of all investors. A longer cooling-off period increases outside investors' welfare but decreases price efficiency. Its implication for the insider's welfare depends on whether the disclosure policy is already in place.

In the context of optimal stopping, we propose a smooth aggregation preference to incorporate all heterogeneous discount rates and an attitude function reflecting the aggregation weight similar to the smooth ambiguity preference in Klibanoff et al. (2005) when handling the model uncertainty. The optimal stopping problem renders to be time inconsistent, for which we develop an iterative approach using consistent planning and characterize all time-consistent equilibrium stopping polices as fixed points of an operator in the setting of one-dimensional diffusion processes. More importantly, we provide some sufficient conditions on both the underlying models and the attitude function such that the smallest equilibrium attains the optimal equilibrium and the attitude function is equivalent to the linear aggregation rule as of diversity neutral.</p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#sequential-propagation-of-chaos","title":"Sequential propagation of chaos","text":"Kai DU Fudan University <p>A new class of particle systems with sequential interaction is proposed to approximate the McKean-Vlasov SDE and BSDE that originally arise as the limit of the mean-field interacting particle system.

The investor is risk-averse with CRRA preference. A relative cost, defined by the difference between the realized cost and benchmark cost given by RS, is considered under utility maximization. Some well-known models and strategies could be included in our framework, with different RS, such as an IS order, a TC order and a VWAP/TWAP order. As an extension of IS order and TC order, we consider the optimal execution with endpoints-only RS and show that the optimal strategy is a linear combination of IS order and TC order. Motivated by endpoints-only RS, piece-wise constant RS is concerned to approximated general RS. Finally, we show that Almgren-Chriss optimal execution problem with general price drift can be solved within our framework.

To overcome this time-inconsistency, Basak and Chabakauri (2010) introduce the game theoretical approach and look for (sub-game perfect Nash) equilibrium strategies, which is solved from the corresponding partial differential equations (PDE) system. In their model, the investor perfectly knows the drift and volatility of the assets. However, in reality investors only have an estimate on them, e.g, a 95% confidence interval. In this case, some literature (e.g., Pham, Wei and Zhou (2022)) derives the optimal precommited strategy under the worst parameters, which is the robust control. The relation between the equilibrium strategy and the PDE system has not been justified when incorporating robust control. In this paper, we consider a general dynamic mean-variance framework and propose a novel definition of the robust equilibrium strategy. Under our definition, a classical solution to the corresponding PDE system implies a robust equilibrium strategy. We then explicitly solve for some special examples.</p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#upper-and-lower-variances-and-their-applications","title":"Upper and lower variances and their applications","text":"Xinpeng LI Shandong University <p>In this talk, we introduce the notions of upper and lower variances for random variables under multiple probability measures and study the related properties.

In contrast to the classic worst-case risk (WR) approach, the MA approach produces not only a robust value of risk evaluation but also a robust distributional model which is useful for modeling, analysis and simulation, independent of any specific risk measure. The MA approach is easy to implement even if the uncertainty set is non-convex or the risk measure is computationally complicated, and it provides great tractability in distributionally robust optimization. Via an equivalence property between the MA and the WR approaches, new axiomatic characterizations are obtained for a few classes of popular risk measures. In particular, the Expected Shortfall (ES, also known as CVaR) is the unique risk measure satisfying the equivalence property for convex uncertainty sets among a very large class. The MA approach for Wasserstein and mean-variance uncertainty sets admits explicit formulas for the obtained robust models, and the new approach is illustrated with various risk measures and examples from portfolio optimization.

Besides the gradient flows, we also propose and study alternative algorithms, such as the entropic fictitious play, to search for the optimal weights of neural networks.

Asset price forecasting is important for describing the evolution of a financial network. Naturally, we wonder whether node centrality affects forecasting effectiveness. We consider networks consisting of major global assets and explore how node centrality affects price forecasting by applying a hybrid random forest algorithm. Two counterintuitive phenomena are found: (i) factors with low centrality have better forecasting ability, and (ii) nodes with low centrality can be predicted more accurately in direction. Using the notion of entropy, which measures the quantity of information, we show that factors with low centrality have more useful information and less noise for the forecast asset price than factors with high centrality do. In addition, while predicting a systemically unimportant node, we demonstrate that the other nodes within the network have a higher information rate concerning the forecast asset. Moreover, our research suggests a criterion for factor selection: when predicting an asset price in a complex system, factors with low centrality should be selected rather than only factors with high centrality. Finally, we verify the robustness of our results using an alternative deep learning method.</p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#continuous-time-q-learning-for-mckean-vlasov-control-problems","title":"Continuous time q-learning for McKean-Vlasov control problems","text":"Xiang YU The Hong Kong Polytechnic University <p>This paper studies the q-learning, recently coined as the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning by Jia and Zhou (2023), for continuous time Mckean-Vlasov control problems in the setting of entropy-regularized reinforcement learning. In sharp contrast to the single agent's control problem in Jia and Zhou (2023), the mean-field interactions of agents render the definition of q-function more subtle, for which we reveal that two distinct q-functions naturally arise: (i) the q-function (denoted by \\(q\\)) as the first-order approximation of the Q-function that can be learnt by a weak martingale condition involving test policies; and (ii) the essential q-function (denoted by \\(q_e\\)) that is employed in the characterization of the optimal policy and the policy improvement iterations. We show that two q-functions are related via an integral representation under all test policies. When the population distribution is not directly observable, we also investigate the decoupled form of the learning mean-field control problem and the associate decoupled q-function (denoted by \\(q_d\\)), and establish its connection to the essential q-function to learn the optimal policy. In both formulations, we devise some model-free offline and online learning algorithms to take care of test policies stemming from the weak martingale conditions. In two concrete examples, one in LQ control framework and one beyond LQ control framework, we obtain the exact parametrization of the value function and all q-functions defined on the Wasserstein space and illustrate our algorithms with simulation experiments.</p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#high-frequency-anticipatory-trading-and-its-influences-small-informed-trader-vs-front-runner","title":"High-frequency anticipatory trading and its influences: small informed trader vs. front-runner","text":"Ziyi XU Peking University <p>In this paper, the interactions between a large informed trader (IT, for short) and a high-frequency trader (HFT, for short) who can anticipate the former's incoming order are studied in an extended Kyle's (1985) model. Equilibria under various specific situations are discussed. Relying on the speed advantage, HFT always trades in the same direction as the large order in advance. However, whether or not she provides liquidity depends on her inventory aversion, the prediction accuracy, and the market activeness. She may supply liquidity back (act as a front-runner) or continue to take it away (in this case we call her a small IT). Small IT always harms the large trader while front-runner may benefit her. Besides, we find surprisingly that (1) increasing the noise in HFT's signal may in fact decrease IT's profit; (2) although providing liquidity, a front-runner may harm IT more than a small IT.

The proposed method consists of two parts: the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN). For the first time, this paper uses a heterogeneous graph model to capture the relationship of the stock industry chain and conducts an empirical study on the Chinese A-share market.Existing research can be divided into two categories: single stock methods and group stock methods. The results of the study show that the proposed model exhibits good performance in terms of investment efficiency and ranking effect. The GRU captures the historical dynamic information of the stock and encodes the features of the price sequence, while the HAN models the relationship between the upstream and downstream heterogeneous graphs of the industrial chain. Existing deep learning-based stock prediction methods mainly focus on single stock prediction or homogeneous graph-based group stock prediction.
