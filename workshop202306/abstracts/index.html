<h4 id="dynamic-capital-allocation-with-reallocation-cost">Dynamic capital allocation with reallocation cost</h4>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Ermo Chen</strong> <em>Peking University</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Traditional static risk capital allocation tools can result in
significant capital reallocation costs for institutions over multiple
periods due to the drastic fluctuations in allocation results. In order
to control these costs, this paper proposes a dynamic capital allocation
problem that incorporates reallocation costs into the loss function and
uses a dynamic programming framework to optimize the problem.
Additionally, the stochastic constraints associated with the full
allocation requirement are incorporated into the problem formulation.
We obtain an analytical expression for the solution of the proposed
problem in a recursive form and demonstrate its performance through
numerical simulations. Our results indicate that the solution opti-
mizes the overall loss function, and the reallocation costs are
worthwhile considering. Furthermore, our approach strikes an effective
balance between addressing current risk profiles and preparing for
future ones. This dynamic capital allocation method successfully
functions as a risk-based capital allocation tool while preserving the
ility of stable allocation. This is a joint work with Lan WU (PKU).</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Yufan Chen</strong> <em>Peking University</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>It has been documented that intraday high-frequency trading activities
exhibit periodicity. In this article, we provides an explanation for
this phenomenon through an optimal liquidation game with a major trader.
This framework contains (i) a major trader who is liquidating a large
number of shares facing an objective with a periodicity and (ii) a
number of minor traders(high-frequency traders (HFTs)) who detect and
trade against the liquidator. All the traders interact with each other
through their impacts on the price dynamics, and we solve this problem
by a mean-field game approach. Our results yield open-loop trading
strategies for both major and minor traders, highlighting the
periodicity in the optimal strategies of all participants. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the presence of minor traders, although without
periodic objectives, amplifies the periodicity of trading speed across
the entire market. This is a joint work with Lan WU (PKU).</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Jun DENG</strong> <em>University of International Business and Economics</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>We analyze two insider-trading regulations recently introduced by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: advance disclosure and
"cooling-off period." The former requires an insider to disclose trading
plans at adoption, while the latter mandates a delay period before
execution. Disclosure increases price efficiency but has mixed welfare
implications. If the insider has large liquidity needs, in contrast to
the conventional wisdom from "sunshine trading," disclosure can even
reduce the welfare of all investors. A longer cooling-off period
increases outside investors' welfare but decreases price efficiency. Its
implication for the insider's welfare depends on whether the disclosure
policy is already in place. This is a joint work with Huifeng Pan(UIBE),
Hongjun Yan(DePaul) and Liyan Yang(Toronto).</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Shuoqing DENG</strong> <em>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>We revisit the collective decision making for a group under diverse
discount rates. In the context of optimal stopping, we propose a smooth
aggregation preference to incorporate all heterogeneous discount rates
and an attitude function reflecting the aggregation weight similar to
the smooth ambiguity preference in Klibanoff et al. (2005) when handling
the model uncertainty. The optimal stopping problem renders to be time
inconsistent, for which we develop an iterative approach using
consistent planning and characterize all time-consistent equilibrium
stopping polices as fixed points of an operator in the setting of
one-dimensional diffusion processes. More importantly, we provide some
sufficient conditions on both the underlying models and the attitude
function such that the smallest equilibrium attains the optimal
equilibrium and the attitude function is equivalent to the linear
aggregation rule as of diversity neutral.</p>

<dt><strong>Kai DU</strong> <em>Fudan University</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>A new class of particle systems with sequential interaction is
proposed to approximate the McKean-Vlasov SDE and BSDE that originally
arise as the limit of the mean-field interacting particle system. The
weighted empirical measure of this particle system is proved to converge
to the law of the McKean-Vlasov process as the system grows. Based on
the Wasserstein metric, quantitative propagation of chaos results are
obtained. Numerical experiments are implemented to demonstrate the
theoretical results.</p>

<h4 id="optimal-execution-subject-to-reservation-strategies">Optimal execution subject to reservation strategies</h4>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Peng GUO</strong> <em>Peking University</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The paper considers optimal execution problems under classical
Almgren-Chriss framework subject to some reservation strategies (RS) as
benchmark. The investor is risk-averse with CRRA preference. A relative
cost, defined by the difference between the realized cost and benchmark
cost given by RS, is considered under utility maximization. Some
well-known models and strategies could be included in our framework,
with different RS, such as an IS order, a TC order and a VWAP/TWAP
order. As an extension of IS order and TC order, we consider the optimal
execution with endpoints-only RS and show that the optimal strategy is a
linear combination of IS order and TC order. Motivated by endpoints-only
RS, piece-wise constant RS is concerned to approximated general RS.
Finally, we show that Almgren-Chriss optimal execution problem with
general price drift can be solved within our framework. This is a joint
work with Xue CHENG (PKU) and Tai-ho WANG (Baruch College, USA)</p>

<p>We study a branching diffusion process with interaction, namely, the

<h4 id="robust-equilibrium-strategy-for-mean-variance-portfolio-selection">Robust equilibrium strategy for mean-variance portfolio selection</h4>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Mengge LI</strong> <em>National University of Singapore</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The classical mean-variance portfolio selection problem induces
time-inconsistent precommited strategies (see Zhou and Li (2000)). To
overcome this time-inconsistency, Basak and Chabakauri (2010) introduce
the game theoretical approach and look for (sub-game perfect Nash)
equilibrium strategies, which is solved from the corresponding partial
differential equations (PDE) system. In their model, the investor
perfectly knows the drift and volatility of the assets. However, in
reality investors only have an estimate on them, e.g, a 95% confidence
interval. In this case, some literature (e.g., Pham, Wei and Zhou
(2022)) derives the optimal precommited strategy under the worst
parameters, which is the robust control. The relation between the
equilibrium strategy and the PDE system has not been justified when
incorporating robust control. In this paper, we consider a general
dynamic mean-variance framework and propose a novel definition of the
robust equilibrium strategy. Under our definition, a classical solution
to the corresponding PDE system implies a robust equilibrium strategy.
We then explicitly solve for some special examples.</p>

<dt><strong>Huafu LIAO</strong> <em>National University of Singapore</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This talk is about the optimization problem of a class of <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span>-particle
systems with centralized control. We establish the regularity results,
which is uniform in <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span>, on the HJB equations corresponding to the
<span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span>-particle system. The uniform regularity results are obtained by the
stochastic maximum principle and the analysis on a Riccati type BSDE.
Using the uniform regularity results, we show the convergence of the
value functions and the optimal controls as the number <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span> of particles
tends to infinity, where the convergence rates are also given. This talk
is based on the joint work with Alpár R. Mészáros from Durham

<h4 id="model-aggregation-for-robust-risk-evaluation">Model aggregation for robust risk evaluation</h4>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Tiantian MAO</strong> <em>University of Science and Technology of China</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>We introduce a new approach for prudent risk evaluation based on
stochastic dominance, which will be called the model aggregation (MA)
approach. In contrast to the classic worst-case risk (WR) approach, the
MA approach produces not only a robust value of risk evaluation but also
a robust distributional model which is useful for modeling, analysis and
simulation, independent of any specific risk measure. The MA approach is
easy to implement even if the uncertainty set is non-convex or the risk
measure is computationally complicated, and it provides great
tractability in distributionally robust optimization. Via an equivalence
property between the MA and the WR approaches, new axiomatic
characterizations are obtained for a few classes of popular risk
measures. In particular, the Expected Shortfall (ES, also known as CVaR)
is the unique risk measure satisfying the equivalence property for
convex uncertainty sets among a very large class. The MA approach for
Wasserstein and mean-variance uncertainty sets admits explicit formulas
for the obtained robust models, and the new approach is illustrated with
various risk measures and examples from portfolio optimization. This is
a joint work with Ruodu Wang from University of Waterloo and Qinyu Wu
from University of Science and Technology of China.</p>

<dd>
<p>Our recent works on the regularized mean field optimization aim at
providing a theoretical foundation for analyzing the efficiency of the
training of neural networks, as well as inspiring new training
algorithms. In this talk we shall see how different regularizers, such
as relative entropy and Fisher information, lead to different gradient
flows on the space of probability measures. Besides the gradient flows,
we also propose and study alternative algorithms, such as the entropic
fictitious play, to search for the optimal weights of neural networks.
Each of these algorithms is ensured to have exponential convergence, and
we shall highlight their performances in some simple numerical tests.</p>

<p>In this talk, we consider multi-dimensional mean reflected backward
stochastic differential equations with possibly non-convex reflection
domains along inward normal direction, which were introduced by Briand,
Elie and Hu in the scalar case. We first apply a fixed-point argument to
establish the uniqueness and existence result under an additional
bounded condition on the driver. Then, with the help of a priori
estimates, we develop a successive approximation procedure to remove the
additional bounded condition for the general case. Based on a joint work

<dd>
<p>We provide an Itô's formula for C1-functionals on the flows of
conditional marginal distributions of a continuous semimartingale. This
is based on the notion of the weak Dirichlet process, and extends the
C1-Itô's formula in Gozzi and Russo (2006) in the context of
semimartingales. As a first application, we study a class of
McKean-Vlasov optimal control problems, and establish a verification
theorem by requiring only C1-regularity of its value function, which is
equivalently the (viscosity) solution of the associated HJB master
equation.</p>

<dd>
<p>We establish Itô's formula along flows of probability measures
associated with general semimartingales; this generalizes existing
results for flows of measures on Itô processes. Our approach is to first
establish Itô's formula for cylindrical functions and then extend it to
the general case via function approximation and localization techniques.
This general form of Itô's formula enables the derivation of dynamic
programming equations and verification theorems for McKean--Vlasov
controls with jump diffusions and for McKean--Vlasov mixed
regular-singular control problems. This is a joint work with Xin Guo and
Huyên Pham.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-node-centrality-in-a-complex-network-affect-prediction">How does node centrality in a complex network affect prediction?</h4>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Yuhong XU</strong> <em>Soochow University</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>In complex financial networks, systemically important nodes usually
play crucial roles. Asset price forecasting is important for describing
the evolution of a financial network. Naturally, we wonder whether node
centrality affects forecasting effectiveness. We consider networks
consisting of major global assets and explore how node centrality
affects price forecasting by applying a hybrid random forest algorithm.
Two counterintuitive phenomena are found: (i) factors with low
centrality have better forecasting ability, and (ii) nodes with low
centrality can be predicted more accurately in direction. Using the
notion of entropy, which measures the quantity of information, we show
that factors with low centrality have more useful information and less
noise for the forecast asset price than factors with high centrality do.
In addition, while predicting a systemically unimportant node, we
demonstrate that the other nodes within the network have a higher
information rate concerning the forecast asset. Moreover, our research
suggests a criterion for factor selection: when predicting an asset
price in a complex system, factors with low centrality should be
selected rather than only factors with high centrality. Finally, we
verify the robustness of our results using an alternative deep learning
method.</p>

<h4 id="continuous-time-q-learning-for-mckean-vlasov-control-problems">Continuous time q-learning for McKean-Vlasov control problems</h4>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Xiang YU</strong> <em>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This paper studies the q-learning, recently coined as the
continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning by Jia and Zhou (2023), for
continuous time Mckean-Vlasov control problems in the setting of
entropy-regularized reinforcement learning. In sharp contrast to the
single agent's control problem in Jia and Zhou (2023), the mean-field
interactions of agents render the definition of q-function more subtle,
for which we reveal that two distinct q-functions naturally arise: (i)
the q-function (denoted by <span class="arithmatex">\(q\)</span>) as the first-order approximation of the
Q-function that can be learnt by a weak martingale condition involving
test policies; and (ii) the essential q-function (denoted by <span class="arithmatex">\(q_e\)</span>) that
is employed in the characterization of the optimal policy and the policy
improvement iterations. We show that two q-functions are related via an
integral representation under all test policies. When the population
distribution is not directly observable, we also investigate the
decoupled form of the learning mean-field control problem and the
associate decoupled q-function (denoted by <span class="arithmatex">\(q_d\)</span>), and establish its
connection to the essential q-function to learn the optimal policy. In
both formulations, we devise some model-free offline and online learning
algorithms to take care of test policies stemming from the weak
martingale conditions. In two concrete examples, one in LQ control
framework and one beyond LQ control framework, we obtain the exact
parametrization of the value function and all q-functions defined on the
Wasserstein space and illustrate our algorithms with simulation
experiments.</p>

<dt><strong>Ziyi XU</strong> <em>Peking University</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this paper, the interactions between a large informed trader (IT,
for short) and a high-frequency trader (HFT, for short) who can
anticipate the former's incoming order are studied in an extended Kyle's
(1985) model. Equilibria under various specific situations are
discussed. Relying on the speed advantage, HFT always trades in the same
direction as the large order in advance. However, whether or not she
provides liquidity depends on her inventory aversion, the prediction
accuracy, and the market activeness. She may supply liquidity back (act
as a front-runner) or continue to take it away (in this case we call her
a small IT). Small IT always harms the large trader while front-runner
may benefit her. Besides, we find surprisingly that (1) increasing the
noise in HFT's signal may in fact decrease IT's profit; (2) although
providing liquidity, a front-runner may harm IT more than a small IT.

<p>Graph Neural Network of Industrial chainThis paper proposes a stock
forecasting method based on a time-series heterogeneous graph attention
network (GRU-HAN), which simulates the complex relationship between
stocks by constructing a heterogeneous graph through the technical and
economic connections among various industries. The proposed method
consists of two parts: the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the
Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN). For the first time, this
paper uses a heterogeneous graph model to capture the relationship of
the stock industry chain and conducts an empirical study on the Chinese
A-share market.Existing research can be divided into two categories:
single stock methods and group stock methods. The results of the study
show that the proposed model exhibits good performance in terms of
investment efficiency and ranking effect.
The GRU captures the historical dynamic information of the stock and
encodes the features of the price sequence, while the HAN models the
relationship between the upstream and downstream heterogeneous graphs of
the industrial chain. Existing deep learning-based stock prediction
methods mainly focus on single stock prediction or homogeneous
graph-based group stock prediction. However, they cannot establish
heterogeneous graphs to simulate the comprehensive relationship between
stocks.</p>
