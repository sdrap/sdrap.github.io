Like any language, they are characterized by a syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). One receiving end is the computer with a very rudimentary form (made of 0/1 and operations on it), while the other is a human with sophisticated one. Hence programming languages are often classified from low level (close to the machine language) to high level (close to human language). Here is a personal ranking of programing languages along this dimension</p> <ul> <li> <p>(Extremely) Low level:     Those languages are the closest to the machine code instructions.     They are extremely efficient as there is no overhead between the instructions and the computer.     However, beyond simple but critical operations, it is virtually impossible to express more complex framework in reasonable amount of time.     Classical example of which is the assembly language (before it was even punching cards).     Current applications are rare but very specific (flight instruments, rockets, cryptography, special algorithm).     Example of assembly language<pre><code>Example:  M  ADD  R1, ='3'\nwhere, M - Label; ADD - symbolic opcode; \nR1 - symbolic register operand; (='3') - Literal\n\nAssembly Program:\nLabel  Op-code   operand   LC value(Location counter)\nJOHN   START     200\n       MOVER     R1, ='3'    200\n       MOVEM     R1, X       201\nL1     MOVER     R2, ='2'    202\n       LTORG                 203\nX      DS        1           204\n       END                   205\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Low level:      Those programming languages are also of procedural nature but with a more natural syntax and semantic with advanced multipurpose functionalities (control flows, recursion, functions, or advanced data structure).     They remain close enough to the machine to be very efficient.      They do not allow for higher level concepts (templating, objects, etc) and require care how to handle memory.     Typical examples are <code>FORTRAN</code>, <code>C</code> or more recently <code>Rust</code>, <code>CUDA</code>.

Remember that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is constructed from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is constructed as the quotient of all Cauchy sequences in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Since we only have access to a bounded subset of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) we can not even construct full \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Furthermore quotients of Cauchy sequences is an operation involving infinity (or the cardinality of \\(\\mathbb{N}\\)) since those are limit objects.
