They are extremely efficient as there is no overhead between the instructions and the computer.     However, beyond simple but critical operations, it is virtually impossible to express more complex framework in reasonable amount of time.     Classical example of which is the assembly language (before it was even punching cards).     Current applications are rare but very specific (flight instruments, rockets, cryptography, special algorithm).

Remember that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is constructed from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is constructed as the quotient of all Cauchy sequences in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Since we only have access to a bounded subset of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) we can not even construct full \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).
