They are extremely efficient as there is no overhead between the instructions and the computer.     However, beyond simple but critical operations, it is virtually impossible to express more complex framework in reasonable amount of time.     Classical example of which is the assembly language (before it was even punching cards).     Current applications are rare but very specific (flight instruments, rockets, cryptography, special algorithm).

Remember that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is constructed from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is constructed as the quotient of all Cauchy sequences in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Since we only have access to a bounded subset of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) we can not even construct full \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).

Numpy has a functionality to return the quantile of a random sample (there are many ways to interpolate it, see documnetation). Given a random sample (as a numpy array) <code>x=[x_0, ..., x_{N-1}]</code> the quantile is given by <code>np.quantile(x, u)</code>. This empirical quantile converges to the normal quantile. Experiment with different random samples from a normal random variable (<code>rvs</code>) and plot the convergence as a function of \\(N\\) of the empirical quantile to the theoretical quantile.</p> Empirical Quantile <p>Note that the general definition of the (right) quantile is given by</p> \\[ \\begin{equation}     q_X(u) := \\inf \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\colon P[X\\leq x] \\geq u \\right\\} = \\inf \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\colon F_X(x) \\geq u \\right\\} \\end{equation} \\] <p>If you have a a random sample \\((x_0, \\ldots, x_{N-1})\\) of \\(X\\), denote by </p> \\[ \\begin{equation}     F^N(x) = \\frac{\\# \\{k \\colon x_k \\leq x\\}}{N} \\end{equation} \\] <p>It holds that \\(F^N \\to F_X\\) if \\(F_X\\) is continuous (is not easy to show, it holds in general gut in a distributional sense).</p> <p>Hence, the quantile \\(q^N\\) of \\(F^N\\) converges too to \\(q_X\\) as \\(N\\) is large.</p> <p>If you denote by \\((y_0, \\ldots, y_{N-1})\\) the reordering of \\((x_0, \\ldots, x_{N-1})\\) from the smallest to the largest value, then it holds</p> \\[     q^N(u) = y_{k_u} \\] <p>where </p> \\[     k_u =      \\begin{cases}         \\inf\\{k \\colon k\\geq Nu\\} &amp; \\text{if }Nu\\leq N-1\\\\         N-1 &amp; \\text{otherwize}     \\end{cases} \\]"},{"location":"material/hw02/#3-average-value-at-risk","title":"3.
