Without entering into the history of computers and their inner functioning, let us notice the following.

Like any language, they are characterized by a syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). One receiving end is the computer with a very rudimentary form (made of 0/1 and operations on it), while the other is a human with sophisticated one. Hence programming languages are often classified from low level (close to the machine language) to high level (close to human language). Here is a personal ranking of programing languages along this dimension</p> <ul> <li> <p>(Extremely) Low level:     Those languages are the closest to the machine code instructions.     They are extremely efficient as there is no overhead between the instructions and the computer.     However, beyond simple but critical operations, it is virtually impossible to express more complex framework in reasonable amount of time.     Classical example of which is the assembly language (before it was even punching cards).     Current applications are rare but very specific (flight instruments, rockets, cryptography, special algorithm).     Example of assembly language<pre><code>Example:  M  ADD  R1, ='3'\nwhere, M - Label; ADD - symbolic opcode; \nR1 - symbolic register operand; (='3') - Literal\n\nAssembly Program:\nLabel  Op-code   operand   LC value(Location counter)\nJOHN   START     200\n       MOVER     R1, ='3'    200\n       MOVEM     R1, X       201\nL1     MOVER     R2, ='2'    202\n       LTORG                 203\nX      DS        1           204\n       END                   205\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Low level:      Those programming languages are also of procedural nature but with a more natural syntax and semantic with advanced multipurpose functionalities (control flows, recursion, functions, or advanced data structure).     They remain close enough to the machine to be very efficient.      They do not allow for higher level concepts (templating, objects, etc) and require care how to handle memory.     Typical examples are <code>FORTRAN</code>, <code>C</code> or more recently <code>Rust</code>, <code>CUDA</code>.

For ease of notations, it turns out that python adopts from the beginning the shorthand writing exposed above. In other terms you don't need to specify the domain and image of a function explicitly. The compiler will figure out by itself according to the nature of the input and the function itself:</p> <ol> <li>are the inputs valid?</li> <li>can the inputs be processed through the function?</li> <li>the type of the output?</li> </ol> <p>This is a daunting task to ask for a programming language if you think about it.

It has smart way to check for any step above, yet, it comes at efficiency costs and sometimes issues in terms of predictability has it takes control of the procedure that you may not have thought about.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>If you define <code>x=1</code> and <code>y=3.5</code>, then <code>x</code> is of integer type while <code>y</code> is of float type. Nevertheless you can define <code>x+y</code> which is equal to <code>4.5</code> which is natural, however combines a priori in an operation elements from different domains, and the result is a float. Yet, if you define <code>y = \"hello\"</code> to be a string, <code>x+y</code> is going to be an error as there is no way to infer for the compiler how to sum an integer with a string.</p>"},{"location":"lecture/03-functions-classes/#function","title":"Function","text":"<p>A function in a programming language is exactly the same as in math, it takes and input and return an output. A function is define using <code>def f(x):</code> where <code>def</code> is a keyword indicating that we define a function, <code>f</code> is the name of the function and <code>x</code> are the variables or input to be considered for this function. The content of the function is then specified with an indentation to delimit the scope of this function. After definition, this function can always be called with <code>f(x)</code> for a specific value of <code>x</code> just as in math.</p> <p>The most basic function (I won't speak about the empty function) is the constant function.
