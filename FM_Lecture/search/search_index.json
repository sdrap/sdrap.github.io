This lecture serves as an introduction to the mathematical theory underpinning modern finance. The course aims to introduce mathematical concepts in finance through the following topics:</p> <ul> <li> <p>One-period financial markets: Financial assets, self-financing strategies, arbitrage, the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, and option pricing.   From a mathematical perspective, this introduces probability spaces, expectations, pricing measures, and measure changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modern risk management and quantification: Value at Risk (V@R), Expected Shortfall (ES), and systemic risk.   From a mathematical perspective, this introduces the concept of probability distribution (CDF, PDF, quantile), joint distributions and tail risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multi-period financial markets: Concepts of information, the CRR model, pricing and hedging, exotic options, stopping times, and American options.   This includes mathematical concepts such as filtrations, conditional expectations, martingales, and stopping times.</p> </li> <li> <p>Basics of ruin theory and default pricing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Continuous-time financial markets: Introduction to the Black-Scholes framework.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#concrete-approach","title":"Concrete Approach","text":"<p>The course combines blackboard lectures with practical applications in Python.
