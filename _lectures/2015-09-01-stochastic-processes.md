### Actual Informations:

2015-09-14
:    Dear all, since most of you never really heard a full lecture on general measure and integration theory I decided to dedicate the first 2 to 3 weeks of the lecture to present it (with all the definitions, most important properties, proofs).
I will also provide the script at the end of each lecture and not every week so that you can work home with the right concepts (and not struggling with my very bad handwriting as I noticed ;) ).


### When/Where

From 2015.09.14 to 2016.01.04

Monday: 14-15:40  
Wednesday: 10-12  
Place: Chen Ruiqiu Building, room 107  

Office hour: Wednesday from 13:00 to 15:30  
Office: Math building, room 2.105

Teaching Assistant: Zhang Youyuan <volwc@sjtu.edu.cn>

### Course Description

This lecture is an introduction to the theory of stochastic processes, with a special focus on Martingale Theory.
The discrete time framework is first addressed and then the continuous time with the construction of Ito's integral.
One finally address with the help of Ito's Formula some Stochastic differential equations.
Throughout the whole course we illustrate the theory by means of examples within financial mathematics.


### Lecture Organization

* Blackboard lecture. I Provide definition, motivation, theorems but sometimes only the main arguments of the proofs.
* You complete the proofs on your own as an exercise.
* In the following week the script on the content of the previous week is provided as pdf at the end of this page in the section [Lecture Material](#lecture-material) so that you can check your own proofs.
* Every week on Monday a set of exercises will be provided as pdf at the end of this page in the section [Lecture Material](#lecture-material).  
The exercises have to be solved by group of three.  
The following week, the teaching assistant will gather the homeworks and give you those of the previous week graded.  
During the first half hour on Monday, a student of one of the group perform the proof of one of the exercises on the black board.
* You can ask for hints to the teaching assistant or myself during office hours.

* Grading: There will be a final written exam at some point during the first of second week of January.
The final grade will consists of one third for the homeworks and two third for the final exam.

### Prerequisites

Measure theory, topology, some basics of functional analysis, and probability theory.

### Literature

The course won't follow any textbook however you might find some interesting/alternative approaches in

[1] "Foundation of Modern Probability", O. Kallenberg, 2nd Edition 2002 (very general but complete)

[2] "Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications", J.M. Steel, 2000 (easy but complete introduction with applications to finance)

[3] "Probability and Potentials B", P. Dellacherie, P.A. Meyer, 1982 (the most general reference, very hard and build upon Probability and Potentials A)
