### Recent Informations:

2015-10-19
:   Update of Chapter 2 and homework assignments are online.

2015-10-14
:   Beginning of Chapter 2 is online as well as Ipython notebooks

2015-10-12
:   I hope you all spend some good national day.
    I corrected some typos in the theorem on conditional expectation -- a notation mistake with $$\mathcal{F}$$ and $$\mathcal{G}$$.
    The third homework assignment is online.

2015-10-04
:   Correction of the homework sheet (typo by the definition of limit superior and limit inferior). Download link at the end of the page.    
    Add some more arguments concerning Hilbert spaces in the lecture notes for the proof of Radon-Nykodym Theorem. Download link at the end of the page.  
    After some questions concerning the difference between collection and family, [I wrote some words about it]({{site.url}}/math/2015/10/04/family-vs-collection/). You can look at the [This and That Section]({{site.url}}/this_and_that/).

2015-09-14
:    Dear all, since most of you never really attend a lecture on general measure and integration theory, I will dedicate the first 2-3 weeks of the lecture to present it.
I will also provide the script at the end of each lecture and not every week so that you can work home with the right concepts


### When/Where

From 2015.09.14 to 2016.01.04

Monday: 14-15:40  
Wednesday: 10-12  
Place: Chen Ruiqiu Building, room 107  

Office hour: Wednesday from 13:00 to 15:30  
Office: Math building, room 2.105

Teaching Assistant: Zhang Youyuan <volwc@sjtu.edu.cn>

### Course Description

This lecture is an introduction to the theory of stochastic processes, with a special focus on Martingale Theory.
The discrete time framework is first addressed and then the continuous time with the construction of Ito's integral.
One finally address with the help of Ito's Formula some Stochastic differential equations.
Throughout the whole course we illustrate the theory by means of examples within financial mathematics.


### Lecture Organization

* Blackboard lecture. I Provide definition, motivation, theorems but sometimes only the main arguments of the proofs.
* Sometimes you complete the proofs on your own as an exercise.
* The script will be provided/corrected/completed every week as pdf at the end of this page in the section [Lecture Material](#lecture-material) so that you can check your own proofs.
* Every week on Monday a set of exercises will be provided as pdf at the end of this page in the section [Lecture Material](#lecture-material).  
The exercises have to be solved by group of three.  
You upload the assignment before the next Monday 14:00 on the server and the teaching assistant give you those of the previous week graded.  
* You can ask for hints to the teaching assistant or myself during office hours.

* Grading: There will be a final written exam at some point during the first of second week of January.
The final grade will consists of one third for the homeworks and two third for the final exam.

### Prerequisites

Measure theory, topology, some basics of functional analysis, and probability theory.

### Literature

The course won't follow any textbook however you might find some interesting/alternative approaches in

For measure and integration theory:

[1] "Measure and Integration Theory", H. Bauer, 2001 (very complete)

For stochastic processes:

[2] "Foundation of Modern Probability", O. Kallenberg, 2nd Edition 2002 (very general but complete)

[3] "Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications", J.M. Steel, 2000 (easy but complete introduction with applications to finance)

[4] "Probability and Potentials B", P. Dellacherie, P.A. Meyer, 1982 (the most general reference, very hard and build upon Probability and Potentials A)
