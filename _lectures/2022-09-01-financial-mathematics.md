### When/Where


From 2022.11.01 to 2023.01.12


Time: from 9:00 to 12:00

Place: TBA

Teaching Assistant: [Tao Xuan](mailto:taoxuan@sjtu.edu.cn)

### Course Objective

The objective of this course is to introduce the mathematics needed for

* pricing of financial assets, such as options and other derivatives;
* optimal portfolio choice;
* modern risk management;

Stochastics as a mathematical field developed parallel to the emergence of the finance industry (first insurance, then stock markets, derivatives, etc...).
This lecture aims at being an introduction to the mathematics needed in modern finance.
We cover the arbitrage theory, pricing of financial assets such as European and American options as well as the optimal portfolio selection.
We also address modern risk management theory such as risk measures and risk allocations which are nowadays of paramount importance in the financial industry.
We illustrate the application of these theories by implementing some classical numerical pricing methods.

### Practical Organization

* Blackboard lecture in English.
* Every week, a lecture note with the content of the lecture will be provided.
* Every week, a homework sheet has to be handed by group of 5 to the teaching assistant and will be graded.
* Every week, the teaching assistant will give a tutorial (correction of the homework sheet, review of some theoretical points of the lecture, etc.).
* Mid term and final exam.
* Prerequisite: A good knowledge of advanced calculus, linear algebra and basic probability theory.
