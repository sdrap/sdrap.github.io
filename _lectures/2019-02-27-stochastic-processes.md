### Course Description

This lecture is an introduction to the theory of stochastic processes, with a special focus on Martingale Theory.
The discrete time framework is first addressed and then the continuous time with the construction of Ito's integral.
One finally address with the help of Ito's Formula some Stochastic differential equations.
Throughout the whole course we illustrate the theory by means of examples within financial mathematics.

### Prerequisites

Measure and probability theory, topology and analysis.


### Lecture Organization
 * Lecture, homework sheet, and exam are in English.
 * Every week a lecture note following what is taught in class is provided on the wechat group.
 * Every week, a homework sheet has to be solved (by group of 2 or 3 students) and will be graded. The homework sheets are available on this webpage, section [Lecture Material](#lecture-material). The homework sheet should be handed electronically to the teaching assistant on Friday before the lecture.
 * Final exam in June
 * Final grade is a pondered average between homework sheet and final exam
