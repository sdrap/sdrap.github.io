### When/Where

From 14.10.2013 to 15.02.2014

Monday: 10-12 MA-651 Mathematics building Strasse der 17 Juni

Tuesday: 10-12 MA-744 Mathematics building Strasse der 17 Juni



### Course Description

Risk and uncertainty are two concepts which became — and not only as a
consequence of the recent economical crisis — more and more important in
public perception and discourse. Though intuitive, these notions remain
particularly blurred as for their definition. They have important
consequences when sound quantitative assessment of risks and
opportunities in face of uncertainty in decision processes are required.

In the course of this lecture, we will study possible mathematical
Ansätze to model and quantify these concepts. This will allow us — via
robust/dual representation — to better understand what are the key
points in the nature of our perception of uncertainty and risk. We,
finally, will also address the important problematic of a coherent
adaptation of the risk perception as time goes by and which consequence
it has in terms of quantification.

Though adopting an abstract “top-down” approach, we will continuously
link and discuss the relevance of our construction with many other
fields, such as

-   Economics: Decision theory, equilibrium…
-   Finance: Monetary risk measures, (super)hedging, regulatory rules…
-   Psychology: Empirical preference ordering, (ir)rationality…

Mathematically, several fundamental fields will play a role, among
others:

-   Ordering theory
-   Topology
-   Functional and convex analysis
-   Measure theory
-   Stochastic processes

### Structure

The 4 weekly hours of the course correspond roughly to 3 hours of
lecture and 1 hour of exercises. We will cover the following points (the
laters, subject to time constraints).

-   Preference orders, their numerical representations, Debreu’s
    Gap-Theorem
-   Robust representation of risk measures (Bipolar and Fenchel-Moreau
    theorem towards a dual representation of quasiconvex lower
    semicontinuous functionals)
-   Application and interpretation for different setups (random
    variables, probability distributions, von Neumann and Morgenstern
    representationldots)
-   Incomplete preferences, conditional quantification of risk
-   Dynamic consistency

### Prerequisites

Even if we will introduce the necessary mathematical concepts and prove
all the results, some knowledge in the following topics is desirable:

-   Functional analysis and topology (Hahn-Banach Theorem, some notions
    of duality, Fenchel-Moreau Theorem is a plus).
-   Probability Theory I & II (Financial Mathematics is a plus)

Therefore, the lecture is more adapted to master students.
