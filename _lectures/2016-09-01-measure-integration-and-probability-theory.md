### Course Description

This lecture is about measure, integration and probability theory.
Calculus is a requirement, and it is rather targeted at graduate students as well as PhD students.
Though, senior undergraduate students are welcome to attend.

#### Practical organization
 * Lecture, homework sheet, and exam are in English.
 * Every week a lecture note following what is taught in class is provided on this webpage, section [Lecture Material](#lecture-material)
 * Every week, a homework sheet has to be solved (by group of 2 or 3 students) and will be graded. The homework sheets are available on this webpage, section [Lecture Material](#lecture-material). The homework sheet should be handed electronically to the teaching assistant on Wednesday before the next lecture.
 * Final exam in January
 * Final grade is a pondered average between homework sheet and final exam
