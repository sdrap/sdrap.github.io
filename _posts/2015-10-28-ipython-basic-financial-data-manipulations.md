The python library `pandas` allows to load and manipulate large sets of data for analysis.
The following Ipython notebook shows basic manipulations that you can realize using this library for financial purposes.
The notebook is written with a fresh installation of Anaconda with Python 3.4.
You will need to install the following packages with Anaconda's terminal if they are not already there:

> `conda install seaborn`

for the plotting library and 

> `pip install pandas_datareader`

If you need more information how to use pandas, consult the [10 minutes to pandas tutorial](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) as well as the [full tutorial](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html).

Here is the [Ipython notebook]({{site.url}}/downloads/Ipython_Notebooks/Download_and_Basic_Manipulation_Financial_Data.ipynb).
