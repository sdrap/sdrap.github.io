We call the resulting distance the smoothed empirical martingale projection distance (SE-MPD), for which we obtain an explicit characterization. We also show that the space of martingale couplings remains invariant under the smoothing operation. We study the asymptotic limit of the SE-MPD, which converges at a parametric rate as the sample size increases if the pairs are either i.i.d. or satisfy appropriate mixing assumptions. Additional finite-sample results are also investigated. Using these results, we introduce a novel consistent martingale coupling hypothesis test, which we apply to test the existence of arbitrage opportunities in recently introduced neural network-based generative models for asset pricing calibration.</p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#mean-field-games-approach-to-systemic-risk","title":"Mean Field Games approach to Systemic Risk","text":"Nizar Touzi New York University <p>Connections between economic agents are desirable for risk diversification purposes. However, they may also be responsible for default contagion, a major concern at the heart of the financial stability of the system. We develop a model of system connection based on the strategic interaction between economic agents. We solve explicitly the mean field limit of the problem in the case of uncorrelated idiosyncratic risks, and we provide a quasi explicit solution of the mean field game. This allows to provide an approximate Nash equilibrium for the finite population problem. We also solve the case of correlated idiosyncratic risk through some common factor by analyzing an appropriate notion of no arbitrage in this context.</p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#tba","title":"TBA","text":"Xin Guo Berkley University <p>TBA</p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#deep-learning-conditional-distributions-on-continuous-spaces","title":"Deep learning conditional distributions on continuous spaces","text":"Ziteng Cheng University of Toronto <p>We investigate sample-based learning of conditional distributions on multi-dimensional unit boxes, allowing for different dimensions of the input and output spaces. Our approach leverages grouping data in proximity to varying query points, employing two distinct methods: one based on a fixed-radius ball and the other on nearest neighbors. We establish upper bounds for the convergence rates of both methods and, from these bounds, deduce optimal configurations for the radius and the number of neighbors. To obtain a Lipschitz continuous estimator of the conditional distribution for enhanced certifiability, we incorporate the nearest neighbor method into neural network training. For improved efficiency, the training process utilizes approximate nearest neighbor search with random binary space partitioning. Additionally, it employs Sinkhorn algorithm and sparsity-enforced transport plan for training objective computation. Our empirical findings reveal that, with a suitably designed structure, the neural network displays adaptive continuity.

In this talk we propose to study the set of values over all possible equilibria, called the set value of games. This set value is by nature unique, and it shares many nice properties of the value function for a standard control problem. In particular, it satisfies the dynamic programming principle and the regularity/stability. We shall also discuss how to characterize the dynamic set value function of games through set valued Hamiltonians and set valued PDEs. The talk is based on a series of works, joint with Feinstein, Iseri, Qiao, and Rudloff.</p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#the-two-square-root-laws-of-market-impact-and-the-role-of-sophisticated-market-participants","title":"The two square root laws of market impact and the role of sophisticated market participants","text":"Mathieu Rosenbaum Ecole Polytechnique <p>The goal of this work is to disentangle the roles of volume and participation rate in the price response of the market to a sequence of orders. To do so, we use an approach where price dynamics are derived from the order flow via no arbitrage constraints and make connections with the rough volatility paradigm. We also introduce in the model sophisticated market participants having superior abilities to analyse market dynamics. Our results lead to two square root laws of market impact, with respect to executed volume and with respect to participation rate.

If the McKean-Vlasov diffusion is the gradient flow of a convex mean-field potential functional, we show that the self-interacting process exponentially converges towards its unique invariant measure close to that of the McKean-Vlasov diffusion.

An iteration procedure yields cost-adjusted portfolio returns, enabling the formulation of portfolio-choice problems as optimization of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). This method reproduces the theoretical results available for one risky asset and the numerical approximations available for two risky assets through finite-elements. Crucially, the RNN model scales to several assets and is fully interpretable, as its parameters identify their no-trade region. Importance-sampling significantly enhances the model\u2019s performance, especially with several assets. An application to equally-weighted funds demonstrates the method's ability to reduce both tracking error and tracking difference from an empirical target.

Pre-hedging can benefit both parties: improved risk management over an expanded horizon then enables the dealer to charge reduced spreads that more than offset any adverse impact the pre-hedging activity has on the execution price. However, when a dealer pre-hedges too aggressively, this can be detrimental to the client. This result is robust to a setting where competing dealers simultaneously pre-hedge. Counter-productive pre-hedge activity can be mitigated by introducing timing uncertainty of the potential trade. (Joint work with Roel Oomen.

In this talk, we consider the impact of proportional transaction costs on risk-sharing equilibria between two agents with mean-variance preferences. The state of the economy is modelled by an underlying diffusion process leading to stochastic investment opportunities for the agents. Our model allows us to observe new effects resulting from the interplay between the transaction costs and the stochastic investment opportunities. This includes solving a new two-dimensional free boundary problem rather than the one-dimensional versions that appear in models with constant coefficients.

Much of the attention and success, however, has been for the discrete-time setting. Continuous-time RL, despite its natural analytical connection to stochastic controls, has been largely unexplored and with limited progress. In particular, characterising sample efficiency for continuous-time RL algorithms remains a challenging and open problem. In this talk, we will discuss some recent advances in the convergence rate analysis for the episodic linear-convex RL problem, and report regret bounds of various learning algorithms.  The approach is probabilistic, involving analysing learning efficiency using concentration inequalities for correlated observations, and quantifying the performance of feedback controls derived from estimated models. The latter is achieved via the stability of the associated forward-backward stochastic differential equation. </p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#rough-stochastic-differential-equations-with-jumps","title":"Rough Stochastic Differential Equations with Jumps","text":"Andrew Allan Durham University <p>The theory of rough paths provides a framework for the study of nonlinear systems driven by highly oscillatory (deterministic) signals. The corresponding analysis is inherently distinct from that of classical stochastic calculus, and neither theory alone is able to satisfactorily handle hybrid systems driven by both rough and stochastic noise (as sometimes appear, e.g., in stochastic filtering, pathwise stochastic control, and mixed Black-Scholes models). The introduction of the stochastic sewing lemma (Khoa L\u00ea, 2020) has paved the way for a theory which can efficiently handle such hybrid systems. In this talk, we will discuss how this can be done in a general setting which allows for jump discontinuities in both sources of noise.

We adopt a generic stochastic model to capture the dynamics of the order book as a series of queueing systems. This generic model is state-dependent and encompasses stylized factors. We subsequently derive semi-analytical expressions to compute the relevant probabilities within the context of state-dependent stochastic order flows. These probabilities cover various scenarios, including the probability of a change in the mid-price, the execution probabilities of orders posted at the best quotes, and those posted at a price level deeper in the book, before the opposite best quote moves. Lastly, we conduct extensive numerical experiments using real order book data from the foreign exchange spot market.</p>"},{"location":"abstracts/#markov-decision-processes-under-model-uncertainty","title":"Markov Decision Processes under Model Uncertainty","text":"Ariel Neufeld Nanyang Technical University <p>In this talk we introduce a general framework for Markov decision problems under model uncertainty in a discrete-time infinite horizon setting. By providing a dynamic programming principle we obtain a local-to-global paradigm, namely solving a local, i.e., a one time-step robust optimization problem leads to an optimizer of the global (i.e. infinite time-steps) robust stochastic optimal control problem, as well as to a corresponding worst-case measure.Moreover, we apply this framework to portfolio optimization involving data of the S&amp;P 500. We present two different types of ambiguity sets; one is fully data-driven given by a Wasserstein-ball around the empirical measure, the second one is described by a parametric set of multivariate normal distributions, where the corresponding uncertainty sets of the parameters are estimated from the data. It turns out that in scenarios where the market is volatile or bearish, the optimal portfolio strategies from the corresponding robust optimization problem outperforms the ones without model uncertainty, showcasing the importance of taking model uncertainty into account.

Since dividend payments are irreversible, this problem corresponds to a singular control problem with a risk-neutral utility function applied to the discounted dividend stream. In cases where the company's surplus process encounters model ambiguity under the Brownian filtration, we explore robust dividend payment strategies in worst-case scenarios. Two possible robust preferences are examined and compared. Using Epstein-Zin (EZ) preferences, we formulate the robust dividend problem as a recursive utility function with the EZ aggregator within a singular control framework. We investigate the existence and uniqueness of the EZ dividend problem. By employing Backward Stochastic Differential Equation theory, we demonstrate that the EZ formulation is equivalent to the maximin problem involving risk-neutral utility on the discounted dividend stream, incorporating Meanhout's regularity that reflects investors' ambiguity aversion. In other words, we establish a connection between ambiguity aversion in a robust singular control problem and risk aversion in EZ preferences. Additionally, considering the equivalent Meanhout's preferences, we solve the robust dividend problem using a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approach combined with a variational inequality (VI). Our solution is obtained through a novel shooting method that simultaneously satisfies the VI and boundary conditions.
