The corresponding analysis is inherently distinct from that of classical stochastic calculus, and neither theory alone is able to satisfactorily handle hybrid systems driven by both rough and stochastic noise (as sometimes appear, e.g., in stochastic filtering, pathwise stochastic control, and mixed Black-Scholes models). The introduction of the stochastic sewing lemma (Khoa L\u00ea, 2020) has paved the way for a theory which can efficiently handle such hybrid systems. In this talk, we will discuss how this can be done in a general setting which allows for jump discontinuities in both sources of noise.

By providing a dynamic programming principle we obtain a local-to-global paradigm, namely solving a local, i.e., a one time-step robust optimization problem leads to an optimizer of the global (i.e. infinite time-steps) robust stochastic optimal control problem, as well as to a corresponding worst-case measure.Moreover, we apply this framework to portfolio optimization involving data of the S&amp;P 500. We present two different types of ambiguity sets; one is fully data-driven given by a Wasserstein-ball around the empirical measure, the second one is described by a parametric set of multivariate normal distributions, where the corresponding uncertainty sets of the parameters are estimated from the data. It turns out that in scenarios where the market is volatile or bearish, the optimal portfolio strategies from the corresponding robust optimization problem outperforms the ones without model uncertainty, showcasing the importance of taking model uncertainty into account.

In this talk, we consider the impact of proportional transaction costs on risk-sharing equilibria between two agents with mean-variance preferences. The state of the economy is modelled by an underlying diffusion process leading to stochastic investment opportunities for the agents. Our model allows us to observe new effects resulting from the interplay between the transaction costs and the stochastic investment opportunities. This includes solving a new two-dimensional free boundary problem rather than the one-dimensional versions that appear in models with constant coefficients.

While stochastic Volterra equations with Lipschitz continuous coefficients are well-studied integral equations, in the case of less regular coefficients many fundamental questions are still open.

We adopt a generic stochastic model to capture the dynamics of the order book as a series of queueing systems. This generic model is state-dependent and encompasses stylized factors. We subsequently derive semi-analytical expressions to compute the relevant probabilities within the context of state-dependent stochastic order flows. These probabilities cover various scenarios, including the probability of a change in the mid-price, the execution probabilities of orders posted at the best quotes, and those posted at a price level deeper in the book, before the opposite best quote moves.

An iteration procedure yields cost-adjusted portfolio returns, enabling the formulation of portfolio-choice problems as optimization of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). This method reproduces the theoretical results available for one risky asset and the numerical approximations available for two risky assets through finite-elements. Crucially, the RNN model scales to several assets and is fully interpretable, as its parameters identify their no-trade region. Importance-sampling significantly enhances the model\u2019s performance, especially with several assets. An application to equally-weighted funds demonstrates the method's ability to reduce both tracking error and tracking difference from an empirical target.

Since dividend payments are irreversible, this problem corresponds to a singular control problem with a risk-neutral utility function applied to the discounted dividend stream. In cases where the company's surplus process encounters model ambiguity under the Brownian filtration, we explore robust dividend payment strategies in worst-case scenarios. Two possible robust preferences are examined and compared. Using Epstein-Zin (EZ) preferences, we formulate the robust dividend problem as a recursive utility function with the EZ aggregator within a singular control framework. We investigate the existence and uniqueness of the EZ dividend problem. By employing Backward Stochastic Differential Equation theory, we demonstrate that the EZ formulation is equivalent to the maximin problem involving risk-neutral utility on the discounted dividend stream, incorporating Meanhout's regularity that reflects investors' ambiguity aversion. In other words, we establish a connection between ambiguity aversion in a robust singular control problem and risk aversion in EZ preferences. Additionally, considering the equivalent Meanhout's preferences, we solve the robust dividend problem using a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approach combined with a variational inequality (VI). Our solution is obtained through a novel shooting method that simultaneously satisfies the VI and boundary conditions.

In this talk we propose to study the set of values over all possible equilibria, called the set value of games. This set value is by nature unique, and it shares many nice properties of the value function for a standard control problem. In particular, it satisfies the dynamic programming principle and the regularity/stability. We shall also discuss how to characterize the dynamic set value function of games through set valued Hamiltonians and set valued PDEs.

Pre-hedging can benefit both parties: improved risk management over an expanded horizon then enables the dealer to charge reduced spreads that more than offset any adverse impact the pre-hedging activity has on the execution price. However, when a dealer pre-hedges too aggressively, this can be detrimental to the client. This result is robust to a setting where competing dealers simultaneously pre-hedge. Counter-productive pre-hedge activity can be mitigated by introducing timing uncertainty of the potential trade. (Joint work with Roel Oomen.

We call the resulting distance the smoothed empirical martingale projection distance (SE-MPD), for which we obtain an explicit characterization. We also show that the space of martingale couplings remains invariant under the smoothing operation. We study the asymptotic limit of the SE-MPD, which converges at a parametric rate as the sample size increases if the pairs are either i.i.d. or satisfy appropriate mixing assumptions. Additional finite-sample results are also investigated. Using these results, we introduce a novel consistent martingale coupling hypothesis test, which we apply to test the existence of arbitrage opportunities in recently introduced neural network-based generative models for asset pricing calibration."},{"location":"abstracts/#juan-li-shandong-university","title":"Juan Li Shandong University","text":""},{"location":"abstracts/#tba_4","title":"TBA","text":"TBA"},{"location":"abstracts/#julien-claisse-paris-dauphine-university","title":"Julien Claisse Paris Dauphine University","text":""},{"location":"abstracts/#mean-field-optimization-regularized-by-fisher-information","title":"Mean-field Optimization Regularized by Fisher Information","text":"Recently there is a rising interest in the research of mean-field optimization, in particular because of its role in analyzing the training of neural networks. In this talk, by adding the Fisher information (in other word, the Schrodinger kinetic energy) as the regularizer, we relate the mean-field optimization problem with a so-called mean field Schrodinger (MFS) dynamics. We develop a free energy method to show that the marginal distributions of the MFS dynamics converge exponentially quickly towards the unique minimizer of the regularized optimization problem. We shall see that the MFS is a gradient flow on the probability measure space with respect to the relative entropy. Finally we propose a Monte Carlo method to sample the marginal distributions of the MFS dynamics.

We establish upper bounds for the convergence rates of both methods and, from these bounds, deduce optimal configurations for the radius and the number of neighbors. To obtain a Lipschitz continuous estimator of the conditional distribution for enhanced certifiability, we incorporate the nearest neighbor method into neural network training. For improved efficiency, the training process utilizes approximate nearest neighbor search with random binary space partitioning. Additionally, it employs Sinkhorn algorithm and sparsity-enforced transport plan for training objective computation. Our empirical findings reveal that, with a suitably designed structure, the neural network displays adaptive continuity.

Simply include MathJax and some mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.</p> <p>Some of the main features of MathJax include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages</p> </li> <li> <p>Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special   setup for the reader</p> </li> <li> <p>Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers</p> </li> <li> <p>Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other   advanced functionality</p> </li> <li> <p>Powerful API for integration with other web applications</p> </li> </ul> <p>See http://www.mathjax.org/ for additional details about MathJax, and https://docs.mathjax.org for the MathJax documentation.</p>"},{"location":"javascripts/node_modules/mathjax/#mathjax-components","title":"MathJax Components","text":"<p>MathJax version 3 uses files called components that contain the various MathJax modules that you can include in your web pages or access on a server through NodeJS.  Some components combine all the pieces you need to run MathJax with one or more input formats and a particular output format, while other components are pieces that can be loaded on demand when needed, or by a configuration that specifies the pieces you want to combine in a custom way.  For usage instructions, see the MathJax documentation.</p> <p>Components provide a convenient packaging of MathJax's modules, but it is possible for you to form your own custom components, or to use MathJax's modules directly in a node application on a server.  There are web examples showing how to use MathJax in web pages and how to build your own components, and node examples illustrating how to use components in node applications or call MathJax modules directly.</p>"},{"location":"javascripts/node_modules/mathjax/#whats-in-this-repository","title":"What's in this Repository","text":"<p>This repository contains only the component files for MathJax, not the source code for MathJax (which are available in a separate MathJax source repository).
