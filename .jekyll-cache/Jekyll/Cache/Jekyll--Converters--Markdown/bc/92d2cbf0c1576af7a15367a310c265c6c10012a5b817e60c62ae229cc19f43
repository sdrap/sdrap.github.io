I"Ë<p>Some of you questioned the difference between â€œcollectionâ€ and/or â€œfamilyâ€ concepts, terms that appeared at different places in the lecture.
Even in the math community â€“ myself included â€“ there is often confusion between these two concepts, and both are used with some inconsistencies.
However, as long as it is clear what is meant for the writer and the reader, there is actually no real problem.
Let me stress the difference between both</p>
