  <p>The following is by no means â€˜theâ€™ introduction on how to write mathematical proofs in English â€“ English is my third tongue, therefore I do not master it very well myself. Just take the following as building blocks so that I can follow your proofs.
After a while, you may improve by looking at proof arguments in professional English textbooks â€“ I am not a reference on that topic. Thatâ€™s also why I recommend you to read only textbooks in English! At the beginning I accept â€“ even if I hate it â€“ the use of logical symbols such as \(\Rightarrow\), \(\Leftrightarrow\), \(\forall\), \(\exists\), etc. in text. Try however to replace them by their English counterparts, it is nicer to read.*</p>
