<h3 id="course-objective">Course Objective</h3>

<p>The objective of this course is to introduce the mathematics needed for</p>

<ul>
  <li>pricing of financial assets, such as options and other derivatives;</li>
  <li>optimal portfolio choice;</li>
  <li>modern risk management;</li>
</ul>

<p>Stochastics as a mathematical field developed parallel to the emergence of the finance industry (first insurance, then stock markets, derivatives, etcâ€¦).
This lecture aims at being an introduction to the mathematics needed in modern finance.
We cover the arbitrage theory, pricing of financial assets such as European and American options as well as the optimal portfolio selection.
We also address modern risk management theory such as risk measures and risk allocations which are nowadays of paramount importance in the financial industry.
We illustrate the application of these theories by implementing some classical numerical pricing methods.</p>
