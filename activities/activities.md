2016 March 11th &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Ernst Eberlein](http://www.stochastik.uni-freiburg.de/emeriti/eberlein) of Freiburg University in Germany
:   **Date:** March 11th  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 305  
    **Time:** 14:00 &mdash; 15:00  
    **Title:** tba   




2016 January 14th &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Ludovic Tangpi](http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~tangpi/) of the University of Vienna
:   **Date:** January 14th  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 403  
    **Time:** 15:15 &mdash; 16:30  
    **Title:** Efficient hedging under ambiguity   
    **Abstract:** It is well known that the minimal superhedging price of a contingent claim is typically too high for the seller in practice. In a non-dominated model uncertainty framework, we propose alternative hedging criteria and, based on an aggregation result and new findings on representation of convex functionals, we derive existence of optimal strategies and dual representation of minimal prices.





2015 October 15th &mdash; Lecture/Seminar Talk by me...
:   **Date:** October 15th  
    **Place:** Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Minhang Campus, Baoyugang library, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 601  
    **Time:** 14:00 &mdash; 15:40  
    **Title:** Multivariate Shortfall Risk Allocation and Systemic Risk

2015 October 8th &mdash; Seminar Talk from Fudan University by [Ulrich Horst](http://horst.qfl-berlin.de/ulrich-horst) of Humboldt University Berlin
:   **Date:** October 8th  
    **Place:** Fudan University, East Guanghua Tower 光华东主楼1801室, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 1801  
    **Time:** 10:30 &mdash; 11:30  
    **Title:** Mathematical Models of Limit Order Books  
    **Abstract:** A significant part of financial transactions is nowadays carried out over an electronic limit order book (LOB) where unexecuted orders are stored and displayed while awaiting execution. From a mathematical perspective, LOBs are high-dimensional complex priority queueing systems. Incoming limit orders can be placed at many different price levels while incoming market orders are matched against standing limit orders according to a set of priority rules. The inherent complexity of limit order books renders their mathematical analysis challenging. In this talk we review recent results on scaling limits for LOBs. Specifically, we consider queueing theoretic LOB models whose dynamics converges to a coupled PDE or SPDE system, depending on the choice of scaling. Our models are flexible enough to allow for a dependence of price dynamics on standing order volumes. This captures the well-documented empirical fact that order imbalances at the top of the book are a significant determinant of stock price dynamics over short time spans.


2015 September 7-10th &mdash; Lecture series by [Michael Kupper](http://cms.uni-konstanz.de/math/kupper/) of Konstanz University
:   **Date:** September 7th, 8th, 9th (eventually 10th if needed)  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 305  
    **Time:** 9:00 &mdash; 11:00  
    **Title:** Risk Measures and Duality Formulas for Robust Pricing and Hedging  
    **Abstract:** The lecture focuses on the pricing and hedging of derivatives in financial markets under model uncertainty. We first give a short introduction to risk measures and discuss several examples such as the mean-variance, the value at risk, and the average value at risk. Based on a convex version of the Daniell-Stone theorem we then derive a dual representation result for increasing convex functions with countably additive measures. As an application of the duality result, we discuss model free superhedging, give the link to transport problems, and derive duality formulas for robust pricing and hedging in discrete time financial markets.


2015 August 19th &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Stéphane Crépey](http://grozny.maths.univ-evry.fr/pages_perso/crepey/) of Evry University
:   **Date:** August 19th  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 203  
    **Time:** 10:30 &mdash; 11:30  
    **Title:** Central Clearing Valuation Adjustment (joint work with Yannick Armenti, university of Evry and LCH.Clearnet)  
    **Abstract:** We develop an XVA analysis of centrally cleared trading, parallel to the one that has been developed in the last years for bilateral transactions. A dynamic framework incorporates the exact sequence of all the cash-flows involved in the waterfall. The total cost of the clearance framework for a member of the clearinghouse, called CCVA for central clearing valuation adjustment, is decomposed into a nonstandard CVA corresponding to the cost of the losses on the default fund due to realized breaches, an FVA corresponding to the cost of funding the variation, initial and default fund margins and a KVA corresponding to the cost of the regulatory capital required from a member of the clearinghouse (and for completeness we also incorporate a DVA term). This framework can be used by a clearinghouse to assess the right balance between margins and default fund in order to minimize the CCVA, hence become more competitive with respect to other clearinghouses. A clearinghouse can also use it to analyze the benefit for a dealer to trade centrally as a member, rather than on a bilateral basis, or to help its members risk manage their CCVA.

2015 April 13-18th &mdash; Team Workshop on Financial Data Modeling
:   **Date:** April 13-18th  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 301  
    **Organizers:** [Center of Mathematical Assessment of Risk of CAFR](http://en.cafr.cn/) SJTU, [Department of Mathematics of SJTU](http://math.sjtu.edu.cn), [Department of Mathematics of Shandong University](http://www.maths.sdu.edu.cn/).  
    **Participants:** Elected students in quantitative finance and related fields.  
    **Meeting Format:** The Team Workshop Meeting is challenged by problems from financial institutions from China, America and Canada. The students with professors form groups to solve the proposed problems with hands-on directions from these financial institutions. The workshop provides an opportunity for the students to experience the whole problem solving process: observation, postulation, simulation and all the way to solutions in an collaborative atmosphere.
