2015 September 7-10th &mdash; Lecture series by [Michael Kupper](http://cms.uni-konstanz.de/math/kupper/)
:   **Date:** September 7th, 8th, 9th (eventually 10th if needed)  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 305  
    **Time:** 9:00 &mdash; 11:00  
    **Title:** Risk Measures and Duality Formulas for Robust Pricing and Hedging  
    **Abstract:** The lecture focuses on the pricing and hedging of derivatives in financial markets under model uncertainty. We first give a short introduction to risk measures and discuss several examples such as the mean-variance, the value at risk, and the average value at risk. Based on a convex version of the Daniell-Stone theorem we then derive a dual representation result for increasing convex functions with countably additive measures. As an application of the duality result, we discuss model free superhedging, give the link to transport problems, and derive duality formulas for robust pricing and hedging in discrete time financial markets.


2015 August 19th &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Stéphane Crépey](http://grozny.maths.univ-evry.fr/pages_perso/crepey/)
:   **Date:** August 19th  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 203  
    **Time:** 10:30 &mdash; 11:30  
    **Title:** Central Clearing Valuation Adjustment (joint work with Yannick Armenti, university of Evry and LCH.Clearnet)  
    **Abstract:** We develop an XVA analysis of centrally cleared trading, parallel to the one that has been developed in the last years for bilateral transactions. A dynamic framework incorporates the exact sequence of all the cash-flows involved in the waterfall. The total cost of the clearance framework for a member of the clearinghouse, called CCVA for central clearing valuation adjustment, is decomposed into a nonstandard CVA corresponding to the cost of the losses on the default fund due to realized breaches, an FVA corresponding to the cost of funding the variation, initial and default fund margins and a KVA corresponding to the cost of the regulatory capital required from a member of the clearinghouse (and for completeness we also incorporate a DVA term). This framework can be used by a clearinghouse to assess the right balance between margins and default fund in order to minimize the CCVA, hence become more competitive with respect to other clearinghouses. A clearinghouse can also use it to analyze the benefit for a dealer to trade centrally as a member, rather than on a bilateral basis, or to help its members risk manage their CCVA.

2015 April 13-18th &mdash; Team Workshop on Financial Data Modeling
:   **Date:** April 13-18th  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 301  
    **Organizers:** [Center of Mathematical Assessment of Risk of CAFR](http://en.cafr.cn/) SJTU, [Department of Mathematics of SJTU](http://math.sjtu.edu.cn), [Department of Mathematics of Shandong University](http://www.maths.sdu.edu.cn/).  
    **Participants:** Elected students in quantitative finance and related fields.  
    **Meeting Format:** The Team Workshop Meeting is challenged by problems from financial institutions from China, America and Canada. The students with professors form groups to solve the proposed problems with hands-on directions from these financial institutions. The workshop provides an opportunity for the students to experience the whole problem solving process: observation, postulation, simulation and all the way to solutions in an collaborative atmosphere.
