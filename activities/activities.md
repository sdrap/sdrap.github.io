2018 March 13th &mdash; [Anis Matoussi](https://sites.google.com/site/matoussianis66) (Universite du Maine, le Mans, France)
:   **Date:** March 13th  
    **Time:** 16:00 &mdash; 17:00  
    **Place:** Minhang, 800 Dongchuan road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** Middle lecture room  
    **Title:** Probabilistic interpretation for solutions of fully nonlinear SPDEs  
    **Abstract:** We propose a wellposedness theory for a class of second order backward doubly stochastic differential equation (2BDSDE). We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution under a Lipschitz type assumption on the generator, and we investigate the links between the 2BDSDEs and a class of parabolic fully nonlinear Stochastic PDEs. Precisely, we show that the Markovian solution of 2BDSDEs provide a probabilistic interpretation of the classical and stochastic viscosity solution of fully nonlinear SPDEs. The talk is based on a joint work with Dylan Possamai (Columbia University) and Wissal Sabbagh (University of Evry-Paris-Saclay).   



2017 November 23rd &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Ariel Neufeld](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~aneufeld/) of ETH Zuerich in Switzerland
:   **Date:** November 23rd  
    **Place:** Minhang, 800 Dongchuan road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 205 Lower hall  
    **Time:** 16:00 &mdash; 17:00  
    **Title:** Robust Utility Maximization with Lévy processes  
    **Abstract:** We present a tractable framework for Knightian uncertainty, the so-called nonlinear Lévy processes, and use it to formulate and solve problems of robust utility maximization for an investor with logarithmic or power utility. The uncertainty is specified by a set of possible Lévy triplets; that is, possible instantaneous drift, volatility and jump characteristics of the price process. Thus, our setup describes uncertainty about drift, volatility and jumps over a class of fairly general models. We show that an optimal investment strategy exists and compute it in semi-closed form. Moreover, we provide a saddle point analysis describing a worst-case model. No compactness on the set of probability measures is necessary. We discuss the general difficulty of providing compactness (i.e. closedness) of semimartingale laws and present a compactness criterion.The first part is joint work with Marcel Nutz, the second part is joint work with Chong Liu.


2017 October 26th  and November 2nd &mdash; Lecture series by [Hans Foellmer](https://www.math.hu-berlin.de/~foellmer/) of Humboldt University Berlin in Germany
:   **Date:** October 26th and November 2nd  
    **Place:** Minhang, 800 Dongchuan road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 205 Lower hall  
    **Time:** 16:00 &mdash; 18:00  
    **Title:** Risk Measures, an Introduction  
    **Abstract:** During these two lectures we will present an introduction to modern risk managment and the mathematics underlying it. This course is based on the fourth chapter of the book "Stochastic finance, an introduction in discrete time".   


2017 October 19th &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Hans Foellmer](https://www.math.hu-berlin.de/~foellmer/) of Humboldt University Berlin in Germany
:   **Date:** October 19th  
    **Place:** School of Mathematics building, 800 Dongchuan road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** Middle lecture room  
    **Time:** 16:00 &mdash; 17:00  
    **Title:** Shifting martingale measures, perceived bubbles, and couplings on Wiener space  
    **Abstract:** In the context of an incomplete financial market model, a shift in the space of martingale measures may induce the birth of a perceived bubble. In joint work with F. Biagini and S. Nedelcu (2014), this is illustrated by a simple flow between two martingale measures such that the price process is uniformly integrable under one of them, but not under the other. To prepare for a more systematic study of dynamics on the space of martingale measures, we discuss different Wasserstein metrics and couplings for measures on path space, and in particular a new version of Talagrand’s inequality on Wiener space that is of independent interest.


2017 September 28th &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Michael Kupper](https://cms.uni-konstanz.de/math/kupper/) of Konstanz University in Germany
:   **Date:** September 28th  
    **Place:** School of Mathematics building, 800 Dongchuan road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** Middle lecture room  
    **Time:** 16:00 &mdash; 17:00  
    **Title:** On the pointwise superhedging duality in continuous time  
    **Abstract:** We focus on the pathwise (model-free) superhedging duality in continuous time. On a $\sigma$-compact path space of continuous functions we show that the minimal superhedging price of every upper semicontinuous contingent claim is equal to the supremum over all its expectations with respect to martingale measures with compact support. As an application we discuss semi-static hedging and the link to Vovk’s outer measure. The talk is based on joint work with Daniel Bartl, David Prömel, and Ludovic Tangpi.


2017 September 28th &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Daniel Bartl](https://sites.google.com/site/danielbartlmath/) of Konstanz University in Germany
:   **Date:** September 28th  
    **Place:** School of Mathematics building, 800 Dongchuan road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** Middle lecture room  
    **Time:** 15:00 &mdash; 16:00  
    **Title:** Characterization of (conditional) nonlinear expectations  
    **Abstract:** In this talk, we study nonlinear generalizations of (conditional) expectations. In both cases, we show a non-linear version of the  Daniell-Stone: A (conditional) nonlinear expectation has some sequential continuity properties if and only if there exists a set of probabilities (a set-valued mapping containing probabilities satisfying certain measurability) such that the (conditional) nonlinear expectation is equal to the supremum over linear (conditional) expectations in this set of probabilities. Further, time-consistency and other extensions are discussed.

    **Organizers:** Shige Peng.   
    **Participants:** Elected students in quantitative finance and related fields.  
   



2017 May 8-12th &mdash; [Fields-China Joint Industrial Problem Solving Workshop in Finance](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/16-17/Finance-IPSW)
:   **Date:** May 8-12th  
    **Place:** Fields Institute, Toronto, Canada  
    **Organizers:** Western University, Shandong University, Institute of Financial Study.   
    **Participants:** Elected students in quantitative finance and related fields.  
    **Involved Industry:** China Security Index Co., China Financial Future Exchange, Scotia Bank, TMX Group.   
    **Further Information:**
    
    * **Objectives:** The objective of the IPSW is to connect industries with faculty, postdocs and graduate students who have expertise in industrial case-studies. This interaction is fostered in the specific context of a problem-solving session over 5 days. The case-studies in question have a significant mathematical or statistical content and are focused on finance.    
        The interaction between industry and academia has many potential benefits for both. Academics learn about interesting potential research problems and find application for their existing tools. Industries get access to some of the most experienced mathematical modellers and problem-solvers on the continent.
    * **Format:** The IPSW will occur over 5 days. Participants will include a group of academic experts (including mathematicians and statisticians) as well as experts from industry. On the first day, the industrial sponsors will present their problem statements. The academic experts will divide into small teams, with one team assigned to each problem. The teams spend the next 3 days collaborating on solutions to their problem, and present their solution on the final day of the workshop.
    * **Deliverables:** At the end of the week, the academic experts make a presentation consisting of the problem restatement and their solution. This is a summary of results; the teams also prepare reports for the industrial sponsors. 



2017 May 3rd &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Marcel Nutz](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~mnutz/) of Columbia University in New York City USA
:   **Date:** May 3rd  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai

    **Time:** 15:00 &mdash; 16:00  
    **Title:** Supply and Shorting in Speculative Markets  
    **Abstract:** We study the formation of prices in equilibrium. In our model, agents who “agree to disagree” interact in continuous time and give rise to a tractable equilibrium that is described by a PDE of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type and  reveals the influence of speculation, short-selling, and exogenous supply.

    **Title:** Workshop on Risk Measures, XVA Analysis, Cost of Capital & Central Counterpartie  
    **Abstract:** In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, new issues were raised concerning accurate derivative pricing and the sound risk assessment thereof. On the one hand, several valuation adjustments (XVAs), such as credit valuation adjustment (CVA), funding valuation adjustment (FVA) or capital valuation adjustment (KVA), were introduced to account for the inherent incompleteness of financial markets. On the other hand, from the risk assessment point of view, one sees a growing concern for the systemic dimension and how to account for it in the capital allocation among different components of a financial system. A related evolution of the infrastructure of financial markets is the generalization of centrally cleared trading and central counterparties (CCPs).  
    All these changes pose important questions at the boundary between challenging academic questions and relevant industrial applications. To address these issues, the University of Evry, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and National University of Singapore are jointly organizing two companion workshops on Risk Measures, XVA Analysis, Cost of Capital and Central Counterparties.  
    The first workshop has been held at the Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore on 18-19 April 2016.

    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 304

    **Lecture Notes, Code, Exercise:** Can be found [there](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~papapan/ComputationalFinance.html), on Antonis'homepage.  
    **Title:** Numerical Methods for Finance  
    **Abstract:** In mathematical finance, the price of derivatives such as options are represented as expectations of random variables, obtained from stochastic models of the underlying assets. Usually, explicit formulas for the prices are not available, i.e. the expectations cannot be computed explicitly. Therefore, numerical approximations play an important role in the finance industry. There are three general approaches to the numerical calculation of expected values.

    1. By the law of large numbers, sample averages converge to the expected value of a random variable if the sample size goes to infinity. This observation leads to Monte-Carlo simulation and its variants like Quasi Monte-Carlo simulation. It requires a method to simulate from the distribution of the underlying random variable. While exact simulation is usually not possible, approximate simulation methods (e.g. Euler approximations of SDEs) are widely available. Therefore, Monte-Carlo simulation is a very general approach to approximate option prices.
    2. If the underlying model is a Markovian model (e.g. given by an SDE), the option price satisfies a PDE, the Kolmogorov-backward equation. Therefore, one can compute the option price by solving the PDE numerically using the finite-difference or finite-element approach. Apart from regularity and (too) exotic path-dependence, the applicability of PDE-based approximation methods is mainly limited by the dimension of the underlying ("curse of dimensionality").
    3. If explicit densities are available, expectation can be written as (low-dimensional) integrals. The density, however, is usually not known explicitly, and even if it is known, direct quadrature (i.e., numerical approximation) of the integral might not lead to a competitive numerical method. However, in many important cases (e.g., Levy or affine processes), the Fourier transform of the density (corresponding to the characteristic function of the underlying random variable) is explicitly known, thus allowing to calculate
the option price using Fourier methods.
    
    In this mini-course, I will present the above mentioned approaches. More precisely, the content of the course will be a selection of the following:
    
    * Pseudo random numbers (random number generation on the computer)
    * Basics of Monte Carlo simulation
    * Quasi Monte Carlo
    * Monte-Carlo simulation of diffusion models: weak and strong approximations, order of the Euler scheme
    * Solving a PDE using finite differences (various finite difference schemes, in particular Crank-Nicolson)
    * Option pricing with Fourier methods
    * Affine processes and the Heston model.

The procedure of extending a vector valued function into a conditional framework is explained which makes tools from conditional convex analysis applicable. Necessary elements of conditional set theory are briefly introduced. Some situations to which the procedure applies are discussed, and applications to vector optimization, risk measure theory and utility maximization are given.

    **Time:** 15:00 &mdash; 16:00  
    **Title:** A class of globally solvable Markovian quadratic BSDE systems and application.   
    **Abstract:** We establish existence and uniqueness for a wide class of Markovian systems of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) with quadratic nonlinearities. This class is characterized by an abstract structural assumption on the generator, an a-priori local-boundedness property, and a locally-Hoelder-continuous terminal condition. We present easily verifiable sufficient conditions for these assumptions and treat several applications, including stochastic equilibria in incomplete financial markets, stochastic differential games, and martingales on Riemannian manifolds.

    **Title:** Mathematics of continuous-time contract theory  
    **Abstract:** In recent years there has been a significant increase of interest in continuous-time Principal-Agent models, or contract theory, in which Principal hires Agent to work on a project and pays him according to an agreed upon contract. Contract theory has wide applications in corporate finance, portfolio selection, and financial equilibrium. In such problems, the optimal contract has to be such that both Principal and Agent solve optimally their stochastic control problems. In contrast to discrete-time models, continuous-time models provide a powerful and elegant framework in which the solution of Principal-Agent problems is mathematically challenging, results obtained are also economically important. In this continuous-time framework, stochastic control theory and backward stochastic differential equations play a special role. We will discuss seminal papers of  Holmström and Milgrom (1987), Sannikov (2008), and DeMarzo and Sannikov (2006).

2016 March 11th &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Ernst Eberlein](http://www.stochastik.uni-freiburg.de/emeriti/eberlein) of Freiburg University in Germany
:   **Date:** March 11th  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 305  
    **Time:** 14:00 &mdash; 15:00  
    **Title:** A defaultable asset price model and two price valuation  
    **Abstract:** In classical economic theory the law of one price prevails and market participants trade freely in both directions at the same price. This approach is appropriate for perfectly liquid markets. In the absence of sufficient liquidity, the law of one price has to be replaced by a two price economy where market participants continue to trade freely with the market but the terms of trade now depend on the direction of the trade. The two prices are given by nonlinear expectation operators.  
    After outlining this new approach we demonstrate its applicability in the context of an asset price model which takes default into account. Negative dependence between asset price and default probability is implemented as a key property. Purely discontinuous Lévy processes are used as drivers for the asset price process as well as for the hazard process which is used to model credit risk. Some pricing formulas for derivatives are explicitly given and numerical aspects to evaluate these formulas are discussed.  


2016 January 14th &mdash; Seminar Talk by [Ludovic Tangpi](http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~tangpi/) of the University of Vienna

    **Title:** Efficient hedging under ambiguity   
    **Abstract:** It is well known that the minimal superhedging price of a contingent claim is typically too high for the seller in practice. In a non-dominated model uncertainty framework, we propose alternative hedging criteria and, based on an aggregation result and new findings on representation of convex functionals, we derive existence of optimal strategies and dual representation of minimal prices.

2015 October 8th &mdash; Seminar Talk from Fudan University by [Ulrich Horst](http://horst.qfl-berlin.de/ulrich-horst) of Humboldt University Berlin
:   **Date:** October 8th  
    **Place:** Fudan University, East Guanghua Tower 光华东主楼1801室, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 1801  
    **Time:** 10:30 &mdash; 11:30  
    **Title:** Mathematical Models of Limit Order Books  
    **Abstract:** A significant part of financial transactions is nowadays carried out over an electronic limit order book (LOB) where unexecuted orders are stored and displayed while awaiting execution. From a mathematical perspective, LOBs are high-dimensional complex priority queueing systems. Incoming limit orders can be placed at many different price levels while incoming market orders are matched against standing limit orders according to a set of priority rules. The inherent complexity of limit order books renders their mathematical analysis challenging. In this talk we review recent results on scaling limits for LOBs. Specifically, we consider queueing theoretic LOB models whose dynamics converges to a coupled PDE or SPDE system, depending on the choice of scaling. Our models are flexible enough to allow for a dependence of price dynamics on standing order volumes. This captures the well-documented empirical fact that order imbalances at the top of the book are a significant determinant of stock price dynamics over short time spans.


2015 September 7-10th &mdash; Lecture series by [Michael Kupper](http://cms.uni-konstanz.de/math/kupper/) of Konstanz University
:   **Date:** September 7th, 8th, 9th (eventually 10th if needed)  
    **Place:** SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Road, Shanghai  
    **Room:** 305  
    **Time:** 9:00 &mdash; 11:00  
    **Title:** Risk Measures and Duality Formulas for Robust Pricing and Hedging  
    **Abstract:** The lecture focuses on the pricing and hedging of derivatives in financial markets under model uncertainty. We first give a short introduction to risk measures and discuss several examples such as the mean-variance, the value at risk, and the average value at risk. Based on a convex version of the Daniell-Stone theorem we then derive a dual representation result for increasing convex functions with countably additive measures. As an application of the duality result, we discuss model free superhedging, give the link to transport problems, and derive duality formulas for robust pricing and hedging in discrete time financial markets.

    **Title:** Central Clearing Valuation Adjustment (joint work with Yannick Armenti, university of Evry and LCH.Clearnet)  
    **Abstract:** We develop an XVA analysis of centrally cleared trading, parallel to the one that has been developed in the last years for bilateral transactions. A dynamic framework incorporates the exact sequence of all the cash-flows involved in the waterfall. The total cost of the clearance framework for a member of the clearinghouse, called CCVA for central clearing valuation adjustment, is decomposed into a nonstandard CVA corresponding to the cost of the losses on the default fund due to realized breaches, an FVA corresponding to the cost of funding the variation, initial and default fund margins and a KVA corresponding to the cost of the regulatory capital required from a member of the clearinghouse (and for completeness we also incorporate a DVA term). This framework can be used by a clearinghouse to assess the right balance between margins and default fund in order to minimize the CCVA, hence become more competitive with respect to other clearinghouses. A clearinghouse can also use it to analyze the benefit for a dealer to trade centrally as a member, rather than on a bilateral basis, or to help its members risk manage their CCVA.
