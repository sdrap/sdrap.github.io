2018 September 25 to October 15th &mdash; Lecture series by [Monique Jeanblanc](https://www.maths.univ-evry.fr/pages_perso/jeanblanc/) Every University Paris France
:   **Dates:** 2018-09-25（TUE），2018-09-27（THU），2018-09-29（SAT），2018-10-08（MON），2018-10-11（THU），2018-10-15（MON）  
    **Title:** Lecture series on enlargement of filtration and applications in Finance (I - VI)  
    **Abstract:** In this series of lectures, we present the role of the information in Finance. We study that problem using the theory of enlargement of filtration. We start from the case of discrete-time martingales and show how the martingale property is lost when the filtration is enlarged. Then, we show how the results can be extended in a continuous time case, and we study the problem of insider trading: we show how a financial agent can make profit using private information, and we give conditions that prevent from arbitrages.

2018 October 8th &mdash; [Jan Obloj](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/jan.obloj) (Oxford University, UK)
:   **Title:** Pricing and Hedging, from theory to numerics  
    **Abstract:** In this talk I review some of the recent progress made in the so-called robust approach in mathematical finance. I explain how this approach can be seen as a way to interpolate between two modelling extremes: the model-free approach and the model-specific approach. The latter is classical and starts with a prescribed probability measure governing evolution of asset prices. The former, in contrast, aims to make statements valid under any probabilistic model and instead focuses on how market data can be used to improve its outputs (e.g., prices and hedges). As we move between the two extremes, we capture and quantify the risk of making assumptions, the so-called “Knightian uncertainty”. I specify to the two particular cases of using market data. First, I discuss the use of liquid prices of call options. This leads to the so-called martingale optimal transport which I introduce and highlight ongoing efforts to develop efficient numerical methods for it. Second, I discuss the use of historical asset prices. This leads to statistical estimators for superhedging prices. The talk is based on joint works with Gaoyue Guo and with Johannes Wiesel.

2018 October 11th &mdash; [Michael Kupper](https://cms.uni-konstanz.de/math/kupper/) of Konstanz University in Germany
:   **Date:** October 11th   
    **Title:** Computation of optimal transport and robust risk aggregation with neural networks   
    **Abstract:** We present a widely applicable approach to solving (multi-marginal, martingale) optimal transport and related problems via neural networks. The core idea is to penalize the optimization problem in its dual formulation and reduce it to a finite dimensional one which corresponds to optimizing a neural network with smooth objective function. We present numerical examples from optimal transport, and bounds on the distribution of a sum of dependent random variables. As an application we focus on the problem of risk aggregation under model uncertainty. The talk is based on joint work with Stephan Eckstein and Mathias Pohl.

2018 October 11th &mdash; [Ariel Neufeld](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~aneufeld/) of ETH University in Switzerland
:   **Date:** October 11th   
    **Title:** Super-replication in fully incomplete markets     
    **Abstract:** In this talk we introduce the notion of fully incomplete markets. We provide two families of fully incomplete models: stochastic volatility models and rough volatility models. We prove that for fully incomplete markets the super-replication price coincide with the model-free super-replication price. Namely, the knowledge of the model does not reduce the super-replication price. In addition, if the claim is Markovian, then the optimal super-replication in fully incomplete markets is of buy-and-hold type. This talk is based on joint work with Yan Dolinsky

2018 December 3rd &mdash; Daisuke Yoshikawa, Hokkai-Gakuen University, Japan
:   **Date:** Monday December 3rd  
    **Title:** Pairs trading under model uncertainty  
    **Abstract:** Since the introduction of pairs trading, this method has undergone considerable development. This method uses the mean reversion of the pair value and the point furthermost from this point; e.g., when the pair value touches the point furthermost from the mean reverted point, it is a time to take a short position of the pair of stocks. For fixing the profit, we liquidate it, when the pair value touches the mean reverted point. This simple trading code will give us the stable profit if model parameters are correctly given. However, the misspecification of the parameters may result in the big loss. This possibility is due to the model uncertainty. To avoid this, we derive the optimal strategy of pairs trading reflecting the model uncertainty; i.e., we use the relative entropy as a penalty function to derive a probability mea- sure which is used for the calculation of expectation of the pair value. Then, we can derive the optimal point, according to the confidence in each agent&rsquo;s estimation. Further, we show numerical examples using market data. Com- paring with other methods, we could show the remarkable stability of our strategy of pairs trading which does not lead to the big loss. Joint work with Mark H.A. Davis

2018 March 13th &mdash; [Anis Matoussi](https://sites.google.com/site/matoussianis66) (Universite du Maine, le Mans, France)
:   **Title:** Probabilistic interpretation for solutions of fully nonlinear SPDEs  
    **Abstract:** We propose a wellposedness theory for a class of second order backward doubly stochastic differential equation (2BDSDE). We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution under a Lipschitz type assumption on the generator, and we investigate the links between the 2BDSDEs and a class of parabolic fully nonlinear Stochastic PDEs. Precisely, we show that the Markovian solution of 2BDSDEs provide a probabilistic interpretation of the classical and stochastic viscosity solution of fully nonlinear SPDEs. The talk is based on a joint work with Dylan Possamai (Columbia University) and Wissal Sabbagh (University of Evry-Paris-Saclay).

    **Abstract:** Algorithm tradings have recently been one of the central topics in mathematical and
statistical&nbsp; finance. In this talk, after giving a general introduction to algorithm tradings and related limit order books, I will discuss two main mathematical problems: optimal execution and optimal placement. I will then continue with the modelings issues of limit order books and comparing&nbsp; LOBs models with the classical heavy-traffic-limit queuing models. I will finally discuss&nbsp; some challenging statistical issues in algorithm tradings.

2018 April 17th &mdash; [Gechun Liang](https://sites.google.com/site/lianggechun1982/home) (University of Warwick, UK)
:   **Title:** Exponential utility maximization and indifference valuation with unbounded payoffs    
    **Abstract:** We solve an exponential utility maximization problem with unbounded payoffs and portfolio constraints, via the theory of quadratic backward stochastic differential equations with unbounded terminal data. This&nbsp; generalizes the previous work of Hu et al. (2005) [Ann. Appl. Probab. 15, 1691--1712] from the bounded to an unbounded framework. Furthermore, we study utility indifference valuation of financial derivatives with unbounded payoffs, and derive a novel convex dual representation of the prices. In particular, we obtain new asymptotic behavior as the risk aversion parameter tends to either zero or infinity. This talk is based on the joint work with Ying Hu and Shanjian Tang.

2018 May 8th &mdash; [Nina Amini](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/perso/nina.amini) (CNRS - CentraleSupelec, France)
:   **Title:** Quantum feedback control and filtering problem   
    **Abstract:** Recent theoretical and experimental advancements have shown the importance of estimation and control theory to study quantum dynamics even thought this gives rise to unusual models that have not been completely explored yet. The new theoretical and experimental results can lead to the development of new quantum technologies, e.g. quantum computer, cryptography, and quantum memory. In quantum control, we can apply different strategies to design a feedback. Measurement-based feedback and coherent feedback are the most common strategies. In this talk, we consider a controlled quantum system whose finite dimensional state is governed by a discrete-time nonlinear Markov process. By assuming the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements in open-loop, we construct a strict control Lyapunov function which is based on the open-loop stationary states. We propose a measurement- based feedback scheme which ensures the almost sure convergence towards a target state. Moreover, I discuss the estimation and filtering problem for continuous-time quantum systems which are described by continuous-time stochastic master equations.

:   **Title:** Hadamard's program for BSDEs with jumps    
    **Abstract:** According to J. Hadamard's famous statement, an equation is well-posed if the following are satisfied: i) there exists a solution, ii) the solution is unique, iii) the solution depends continuously on the initial data. In this talk we carry out the three tasks of this program for BSDEs with jumps. More specifically, in the first part of this talk we will provide existence and uniqueness results for BSDEs with jumps driven by martingales that are stochastically discontinuous, hence we can treat BSDEs and BS&#916;Es in a unified and general framework. Then, we will present stability results for martingale representations. The final part consists of stability results for solutions of BSDEs not only with respect to the initial data, but also with respect to discretized versions of the driving martingale.
